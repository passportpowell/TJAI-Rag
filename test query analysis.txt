The test query looks excellent! The system is functioning exactly as designed:

### What's Working Well:

1. **Proper Initialization**: The system correctly loads the CSV file (467 rows, 9 columns) and uses the existing index without rebuilding it

2. **Relevant Results**: All 5 results come from the exact section you'd want:
   - Objective: Modelling Results
   - Task: Hydrogen
   - Sub-task: Hydrogen Grid Flows

3. **Semantic Understanding**: The system understood the natural language query "tell me about the Modelling Results for Hydrogen Grid Flows" and found the most relevant content

4. **Good Scoring**: Results are ranked by relevance with close but differentiated scores (0.4941 to 0.4700)

5. **Comprehensive Content**: The results contain detailed information about:
   - Electrolyzer capacity projections (400 GW by 2050)
   - Renewable vs. grey hydrogen production
   - System flexibility requirements
   - Storage challenges and solutions
   - EU energy transition scenarios

6. **Fast Performance**: The query completed in 4.78 seconds, which is excellent

The RAG system is successfully retrieving the most relevant information from your Joule Model Report based on semantic understanding rather than just keyword matching. This demonstrates that the implementation is working as intended and should be valuable for Terajoule analysts who need to quickly access specific information from the report.
