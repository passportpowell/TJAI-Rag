**Methane Supply Projections in TYNDP 2024 Scenarios for Europe (Country: EU) - A Decarbonization Focus by Policy Makers, Technology Service Organizations (TSO), Energy Project Stakeholders, and Non-Governmental Entities**

Figure 32 illustrates the trajectory of methane supply within three distinct TYNDP 2024 scenarios. Each scenario anticipates a convergence towards zero conventional indigenous natural gas production by approximately 2050—signifying an era where traditional fossil fuels cede to renewable alternatives in line with ambitious decarbonization policies.

By the year 2040, we observe substantial shifts: National Trends+ scenario envisages a significant decrease of methane production by nearly one-third compared to its baseline projection for that decade—a stark contrast from earlier years with an indication towards aggressive decarbonization measures. Meanwhile, the Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios target more considerable reductions: DE at 47% reduction juxtaposed against a GA scenario boasting of up to 40%.

Central to this transition is indigenous renewable methane production—biomethane stands out as an essential player in the decarbonization effort, while synthetic methane via electrolysis emerges more prominently within Global Ambition's framework. The overall output of these alternative gases aims to offset conventional natural gas declines and pave the way toward carbon neutrality by mid-century (2050).

The import landscape is redefined with zero levels projected in all scenarios, reflecting Europe’s commitment towards self-sufficiency. Specifically: 920 TWh of indigenously renewable methane characterizes the Distributed Energy scenario by 2050—a modest but meaningful contribution to our energy mix; whereas Global Ambition anticipates a robust supply chain, with an ambitious total output reaching approximately 1.08 billion cubic meters (GWh).

In summary, these projections underscore the pivotal role of biomethane and synthetic m",Executive Summary,Sectors Modelled,Methane,"The forthcoming analysis delineates methane resource dynamics across three primary TYNDP 2024 scenarios, projecting a unified trajectory toward cessation of indigenous natural gas production by mid-century (2050). By the year 2040, there is an anticipated contraction in conventional methane yield by approximately one third compared to baseline projections established under National Trends+ for 2030. Notably, both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios set forth more aggressive targets with reductions of 47% (DE) and 40% (GA), respectively—an indication of their divergent but ambitious pathways toward a decarbonized future.

In the tapestry of renewable methane sources, biomethane stands out as an indispensable element within these scenarios; it not only drives significant strides in emission reduction efforts across all examined cases, but also emerges predominantly responsible for achieving zero-carbon targets. Synthetic alternatives to natural gas complement this landscape by enhancing supply resilience and contributing substantially toward the EU's 2050 carbon neutrality aspirations.

The strategic pivot from traditional methane imports is underscored in both scenarios, culminating in a complete cessation of such practices well before mid-century milestones are reached (zero by year 2050). This transition aligns with the Distributed Energy scenario's unique energy landscape; herein lies lower indigenous renewable and decarbonized methane production, totaling around 920 terawatt-hours in anticipation of mid-century demands. Contrastingly, synthetic alternatives contribute an augmented share—approximately two thirds as compared to Global Ambition's scenario (around 285 TWh). Herein biomethane retains its importance but assumes a more nuanced role in the energy mix by contributing roughly half of this renewable supply.

2,2.4,2.4.3,EU,"The report section delineates methane production trends under various scenarios within TYNDP 2024, projecting a complete cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas output by 2050 due to significant reductions across all considered pathways. By this milestone in the mid-century timeline—specifically at 2040 compared with current levels under National Trends+ —the DE scenario forecasts a notable diminution, achieving an estimated reduction of 47%, while GA scenarios propose more aggressive cuts totaling approximately 40%.

As part of the strategic shift toward renewable energy sources in methane supply chains, indigenous biomethane production is anticipated to flourish. The National Trends+ scenario depicts a progressive amplification over time with limited synthetic alternatives derived from electrolytical processes contributing minimally but growing portions of the overall renewable gas output—a factor sufficient for balancing declines in traditional natural gas availability and promoting sustainability.

Central to this transition, biomethane emerges as a pivotal component within both deviation scenarios; it not only drives decarbonization efforts but also becomes the dominant force behind methane supply renewal processes by 2050 when import levels are projected for complete cessation. Synthetic alternatives continue to play an essential, albeit complementary role in achieving carbon neutrality goals through mid-century milestones and beyond.

Within the Distributed Energy scenario framework—characterized by a pronounced reliance on local renewable sources with modest contributions from both biomethane (635 TWh anticipated for 2050) and synthetic methane production, which is marginally higher at approximately 285 TWh in the same year —the strategic approach minimizes import dependency. By its projected trajectory by mid-century's dawn—specifically around 2040 with zero natural gas imports envisaged for subsequent years up to and beyond 2050, it sets a precedent emphasizing self-sufficiency within the EU’s energy landscape as part of an overarching commitment towards integrated global decarbonization efforts.

The Global Ambition scenario further",Modelling Methodologies,Sector Based Methodologies,Methane,"This report section provides an in-depth analysis of methane production trends within three TYNDP (Technology, Innovation and Deployment Plan) scenarios up to 2050 for Europe's energy landscape: National Trends+, Distributed Energy, and Global Ambition.

By the year 2040, a marked decline in conventional indigenous natural gas production is anticipated across all TYNDP scenarios—reaching zero by mid-century as part of an aggressive decarbonization strategy. Specifically, there will be significant reductions: National Trends+ scenario forecasts a 31% decrease compared to its baseline in 2030; Distributed Energy and Global Ambition aim for more substantial decreases at rates of approximately 47% and 40%, respectively.

These scenarios also project varying degrees of renewable methane generation, notably biomethane (derived from organic waste) and synthetic methane produced via electrolysis. In alignment with their individual pathways toward carbon neutrality by the year 2050, these forms of green gas are envisioned to progressively supplant traditional natural gas output—mitigating decline while bolstering sustainability efforts within Europe's energy matrix.

A critical insight is that biomethane emerges as a cornerstone for decarbonization in methane supply chains, accounting predominantly for the green transition across both deviation scenarios by 2050—with synthetic alternatives also playing an instrumental role to meet increasing demand and achieve zero-emission targets.

In particular: The Distributed Energy scenario projects a modest indigenous renewable methane output of roughly 920 TWh (terawatt-hours) by the year 2050, with synthetic production slightly exceeding its Global Ambition counterpart at about 285 TWh. Biomethane's contribution is substantial yet not as dominant compared to other scenarios—estimated at nearly 635 TWh in that same time frame. Notably absent from the Distributed Energy model are natural gas imports by year-end, highlighting a shift towards self-sufficiency and renewable reliance for energy supply within this framework"
2,2.4,2.4.4,EU,"In this comprehensive energy report tailored for policymakers, industry stakeholders such as Transmission System Operators (TSOs), project owners, and NGO partners within EU jurisdictions, we introduce a sophisticated offshore modelling methodology. This advanced approach diverges from traditional radial connections of wind energy to the domestic market by delineating distinctive zones in an offshore context where infrastructure for each zone—including interconnector links between them—is meticulously modelled and optimized individually.

Such a segmentation enhances efficiency, particularly when considering grid expansion strategies that facilitate wind energy transport across disparate hubs on the sea surface as opposed to radial networks from individual offshore installations back to landfall points.

3,3.2,3.2.4,Malta,"Chapter 3.2.4: Evaluation of Annual Methane Consumption and Demand Trends in Malta (MT)

Introduction
-------------
This chapter presents a comprehensive review of methane consumption within the Republic of Malta, utilizing data from national sources such as entries recorded at key nodes on the Energy Transition Matrix (ETM). The objective is to dissect sectoral contributions towards annual usage and recognize emergent patterns with implications for future energy policies or infrastructure investments related to natural gas exploitation.

Sector-Specific Methane Demand Patterns: An Overview 
------------------------------------------------------
Household consumption takes precedence, driven by substantial heating requirements during cooler periods and the use of methane in domestic appliances like stoves (MT00). On average, households account for approximately 14.8963927% annually based on MT's energy mix from natural gas combustion as per ETM records.

Buildings and commercial activities exhibit a moderate consumption rate of methane attributed to heating requirements in buildings (MT01) alongside specialized uses, such as air conditioning systems powered by the same fuel source – this translates into an annual demand close to 10.513102% based on ETM data points.

The industrial sector's dependency on natural gas is relatively low and includes methane utilization in manufacturing, chemical feedstock applications (MT30), as well as waste management operations essential for environmental compliance while processing by-products – this translates to a minimal annual demand of approximately 0.4987826% according to the ETM's data aggregation framework across these subsectors.

Transport demands methane usage, with international shipping emerging as an exceptional outlier in consumption levels (MT15). The transport sector anticipates a moderate annual demand for natural gas which will be further elucidated upon reviewing specific trends and policy impacts on this segment.
                            
Reference Style Example: Up to 2030, the expectation is that methane consumption in Malta may experience only slight decreases due primarily to increased electrification within residential, tertiary",Demand,Annual Demand,Methane,"Chapter Summary: Analysis of Malta's Annual Methane Demand (3.2.4)  
This chapter provides a comprehensive review of Malta’s annual methane consumption, drawing data from ETM database nodes and conducting sector-wise analysis to understand demand trends across different sectors. The residential area emerges as the leading consumer due to heating requirements during winter months; households are responsible for approximately 0.15 units per year (MT00). Buildings contribute a lesser portion, around 0.10 unit annually, with methane gas predominantly utilized in general building services such as HVAC systems (MT01). The industrial sector's usage is minimal at approximately 0.005 units per year; this encompasses a variety of processes including chemical feedstock for manufacturing and waste management operations to meet environmental standards, with specific subsectors like MT15 highlighted where applicable (various MT30). Transportation within Malta's sector shows moderate demand levels except in the case of international shipping.
 
Projecting into future trends up until at least 2030 suggests only a slight decrease, followed by more substantial declines post-2030 due to increased electrification across residential and industrial sectors offsetting new methane applications elsewhere in the economy. The power sector is set for reduced demand as renewable energy generation (RES) rises significantly.
 
Post-2030, expectations indicate a more rapid decrease in Malta's overall methane consumption due to anticipated surges in hydrogen demand and strategic shifts towards alternative fuels within national plans. However, the continued need for natural gas will persist as part of energy market balancing mechanisms through indirect applications such as supporting abated natural gas processes necessary for hydrogen production (as discussed further).
 
Under scenarios divergent from current trends—focusing on final uses and non-energy sectors like methane's role in the burgeoning field of green technologies, including electrolyzers connected to networks facilitating renewable energy storage solutions—demand for Malta’s natural gas appears poised differently. These projections are grounded upon optimization models incorporating flexibility options such as demand"

Introduction:
This chapter presents a thorough examination of Belgium’s peak methane demand, with an emphasis on the key sectors located in nodes labeled as BE01 (""Provence-Orientale Vlaanderen"" and ""West-Vlaamse provincie/Province de Flandre Ouest"") and node BE02 (Bruxelles Hoofdstedelijke Regio plus Namur Province). Utilizing data from the comprehensive PLEXOS file, we gain insight into methane consumption patterns across these critical areas.

Analytical Summary:
With natural gas playing an integral role in Belgium's energy mix for both industrial applications and transportation needs, understanding peak demand fluctuations is imperative—especially during winter when heating requirements surge significantly due to colder climates. Our objective within this chapter includes a meticulous evaluation of methane usage trends at nodes BE01 and BE02 through:
- Analyzing reported energy consumption figures (Demand)
- Identifying peak demand occurrences 
- Assessing the impact on system stability, storage necessities, dynamic pricing mechanisms like tariffs, as well as participation in methane Demand Response Programs.

Peak Methane Consumption at Node BE01:
The northern region of Belgium presents a pronounced increase in energy demand during winter months—a period marked by heightened heating requirements due to the nation's typically frigid weather, particularly affecting Provence-Orientale Vlaanderen (BE01). This trend highlights residential and commercial sectors as primary drivers of methane usage peaks.

This suggests a parallel dependency on methane for residential warmth and underscores the importance of effective energy planning in these nodes to",Demand,Peak Demand,Methane,"Chapter Summary - Assessment of Peak Methane Demand for BE01 and BE02 in Belgium's Regions (Provence-Orientale Vlaanderen/West Flanders & Bruxelles Hoofdstedelijke Regio + Namur Province):
This chapter delineates the seasonal methane consumption trends within key nodes of Belgium, specifically during winter when heating demands intensify. Analyzing PLEXOS data files reveals pronounced peak usage at both node BE01 and node BE02 regions in alignment with residential needs for increased warmth amid colder seasons. The study investigates the ramifications these peaks impose on energy system stability, storage requirements, as well as pricing strategies incorporating dynamic tariffs and demand response initiatives. A notable correlation exists between heightened methane usage during winter periods with residential heating demands in both regions.
 
Post-2030 projections indicate a more substantial decline in Belgium's methane consumption, aligning EU policy emphasis on the pivotal role of this energy carrier through to that period and beyond. While electrification across residential, tertiary sectors is set to modestly curtail demand until 2030 due to increased use in non-energy applications such as hydrogen production—a factor somewhat counteracted by emergent sectoral demands — thereafter a more significant decline ensues. This pattern arises from anticipated growth of renewables within the power generation sphere, which is expected to reduce methane demand substantially post-2030 due to enhanced RES capacities and operational shifts towards less reliance on gas infrastructure in balancing energy markets.
 
Contrastingly, under deviation scenarios where final consumption drives the need for natural gases—especially those used indirectly as feedstocks or through demand-side responses including DSR and V2G technologies — Belgium may witness a lower methane footprint by midcentury (circa 2040). Here, electrification facilitated via renewables is projected to significantly decrease the necessity for gas in power generation due to reduced full load hours. Such outcomes deviate from present trends and forecasts within National Trends scenarios"

*Abstract Summary*   
This chapter provides a comprehensive analysis focusing on methane peak consumption patterns within the Finnish context, assessing their influence on energy storage needs and grid stability. Drawing from extensive data regarding gas usage trends during winter months—when heating demands are at an all-time high due to frigid temperatures—this study aims to shed light on these critical periods' implications for Finnish infrastructure planning, particularly with regards to energy storage solutions and grid reliability.

*Introduction: Methane Demand Dynamics in Finland (FI)*  
Finnish methane consumption is predominantly linked to residential heating needs as well as industrial processes within the country's unique cold-climate landscape, resulting in notable seasonal demand surges during winter. Acknowledging these peak periods is not only fundamental for ensuring a steady supply but also serves an essential role in planning methane storage and infrastructure to avoid potential shortfalls or grid instabilities when temperatures drop between November and February—a period marked by increased energy requirements for heating purposes across the nation.
  
*Data Analysis: Regional Consumption Patterns Across Finland's Winter Seasons (FI)*   
Our analysis spans several winter periods within different Finnish regions, revealing diverse demand profiles as follows: 
- **Pohjois- ja Itä-Suomi Zone** showcases resilience with no reported shortages. Despite an overall consumption of around 4,863 GWh during peak times—a testament to the efficiency and reliability of Finland's energy distribution mechanisms in meeting steady heating demands without overextending methane resources significantly.
  
- **Länsi/Helsinki-Uusimaa Zone** experiences a contrasting pattern, with substantial demand figures standing at approximately 3,903 GWh alongside shortages of about 1,576 GWh during peak periods. This gap highlights the acute challenges that arise under high methane consumption and points to an urgent need for strategic planning around storage capacity enhancement—to ensure uninterrupted heating supply in",Demand,Peak Demand,Methane,"Chapter Synopsis: The examination of methane usage during Finnish winter peaks reveals a critical need for strategic storage and infrastructure enhancements to manage increased heating requirements due to frigid temperatures, which strain energy reserves and grid reliability. Regional data indicates that Zone 1 effectively sustains supply despite high consumption levels (4,863 GWh), whereas Zones 2 faces considerable shortages with deficits around ~1,576 GWh. These insights underscore the urgency for optimized methane storage solutions and robust infrastructure to cope during peak demand periods.

Looking toward future trends until 2030, Finland is expected only a modest dip in overall methane consumption due largely to electrification across residential areas as well as industry and tertiary sectors; however, this decline will be partially counterbalanced by emerging applications. The power sector's demand for natural gas also diminishes owing to the rise of renewable energy sources (RES).
After 2030, a steeper reduction in methane consumption is projected as national initiatives forecast an upsurge in hydrogen usage—a point which will necessitate continued reliance on methane for market balancing. In scenarios where traditional applications diminish, the demand hinges more heavily upon final uses like non-energy purposes and indirect requirements tied to natural gas utilization within hydrogen production processes.
Global Ambition forecasts a marked increase in these end use sectors by 2040 versus National Trends expectations; yet Distributed Energy scenarios predict an extremely low methane footprint for power generation due to up to 83% reduction of full load hours, facilitated through diverse flexibility options such as demand-side response (DSR), vehicle-to-grid technology (V2G) integration with hydrogen networks and storage. This forecast diverges markedly from current consumption patterns or National Trends projections—elaboration on these dynamics is detailed in the subsequent section, specifically within 6.4.3 Electricity Supply Analysis.

In scenarios diverging from current trends—particularly focusing on final uses like non-energy sectors as well as hydrogen generation necessitating methane use, Global Ambition forecasts elevated levels by 2040 relative to National Trends assumptions; however, in both Distributed Energy and Hydro Pump Storage scenarios there is a striking decrease of up to 83% for the power sector's demand. This substantial drop arises from employing an array of flexibility options: DSR strategies, V2G integrations with vehicle fleets, hydro pump storage reserves alongside electrolyzer connections in renewable gas infrastructures—a stark contrast to existing conditions and anticipated trends according to National Trends analysis.
The chapter further discusses the implications of these demand shifts on methane utilization during periods when electricity generation from variable RES resources is minimal, a phenomenon"
3,3.6,3.6.3,Greece,"## Chapter 3.6.3: Assessment of Greek Gas Infrastructure and Peak Methane Demand Patterns

Greece, categorized within node group 'GR01', encompasses diverse regions including Anatoliki Makedonia, Thraki; Kentriki Makedonia; Dytiki Makedonia; Ipeiros. These zones are further segmented into specific sectors such as Zone 2 Tertiary (GR02), which allows us to analyze and understand the methane demand fluctuations intrinsic to Greece's unique energy consumption profile, ranking it tenth globally in peak demands contextually.

Understanding Peak Demand: The scrutiny of Greek gas infrastructure during critical peaks—particularly winter months when heating requirements elevate substantial usage levels and stress supply chains—is vital for strategic energy management decisions by planners, policymakers, TSOs (Transmission System Operators), project owners in the Energy sector, as well as NGOs with an interest in sustainable development.

Methodological Framework: In absence of precise participation metrics from our web exploration, we employ a methodology grounded on comprehensive insights into Demand Response Program (DRP) impact within methane-centric economies such as Greece's. DRP schemes are pivotal for managing peak demand periods by enabling consumer actions that alleviate grid load during high consumption times in key Greek locales, including Attiki and Thessalia among others.

Peak Demand Forecasting: Despite its 10th ranking as a global methane-demand nation—indicating less intensive peaks relative to leading countries but still significant due to geographical factors like winter heating needs in Greece, the demand forecast suggests only marginal decreases until around 2030. This projection aligns with EU's national strategies that foresee a modest decline owing largely to electrification across residential and tertiary sectors—offset slightly by emergent applications in other industrial segments, as well as power sector reductions attributed to increased renewable energy (RES) penetration.

Post-2030 Dynamics: Beyond 2030,",Demand,Peak Demand,Methane,"Chapter Summary: Assessment of Peak Gas Consumption Trends in Greece (GR)
Greece's gas demand exhibits pronounced seasonality, particularly within regions such as Zone 2 Tertiary ('GR02'), where winter months trigger substantial heating needs. Ranking tenth globally for peak methane consumption among twenty-eight nations, the country underscores a pressing need for strategic storage solutions and robust infrastructure to support these fluctuations.
The implementation of Demand Response Programs (DRP) is critical in Greece's approach to managing gas supply during periods when demand surges are most acute—such as winter seasons or peak consumption events across key areas like Attiki and Thessalia. Despite ranking lower than the world’s highest methane-demanding nations, geographical influences significantly shape Greek energy utilization patterns within its infrastructural framework.
At a European Union level, policy measures emphasize gas' role as an essential energy carrier with expectations of modest demand reductions until 2030 due to burgeoning electrification across residential and industrial sectors—partially mitigated by emerging applications in other areas.

*Executive Summary:*  
This chapter offers a thorough evaluation of peak methane requirements within the territory of Croatia, identified by its national code HR. Despite challenges stemming from sparse specific data on energy program engagement during demand peaks, our analysis leverages prevailing industry patterns and comprehensive knowledge about natural gas usage in comparable European nations such as Croatia to draw informed conclusions relevant for strategic planning within the region's unique context.

*Introduction:*  
Delving into Europe’s methane consumption dynamics with an emphasis on HR (Panonska Hrvatska Jadranska Hrvatska), and encompassing regions of Grad Zagreb, Kontinentalna Hrvatska as per the 2016 NUTS classification system alongside Sjeverna Hrvatska within Croatia's borders, understanding peak methane consumption is indispensable. During winter months when heating needs escalate due to lower temperatures in these areas of HR, a thorough comprehension of both the magnitude and behavioral patterns of energy usage peaks becomes crucial for formulating sustainable practices that support economic goals while ensuring grid stability.

Without direct data on Croatia's involvement in demand response initiatives related to methane use, our strategy integrates a multifaceted analytical framework examining several pivotal elements and their relationship with anticipated peak demands mirroring similar European scenarios. This assessment takes into account historical energy consumption trends during colder seasons, economic indicators including natural gas prices fluctuations, governmental policies weighing renewable energies against methane-based fuels like natural gas—the infrastructure's readiness to initiate demand response measures and the influences of typical climatic variations in Croatia are also considered.

*Observed Trends:*  
Historical data points towards a significant uptick during winter months throughout HR, with residential heating becoming predominant energy consumers as temperatures drop to their seasonal lows. Economic factors such as gas price volatility hold sway",Demand,Peak Demand,Methane,"Chapter Summary on Peak Methane Demand Trends in Croatia (HR):
This chapter delves into methane consumption patterns during peak demand periods within Croatia, with a spotlight on winter heating requirements due to colder regional temperatures. Notably, data scarcity regarding energy management program participation rates prompts the use of comparative industry trends from analogous European contexts as benchmarking tools for our analysis. The investigation evaluates key determinants impacting methane demand by examining historical winter consumption patterns alongside economic factors such as gas pricing and governmental policies balancing renewables against fossil fuels, in addition to considering Croatia's unique climate characteristics.

In the European Union context up until 2030, a forecast suggests only minimal decreases for methane demand due largely to enhanced electrification across residential and industrial sectors—a trend slightly mitigated by emerging applications in various other areas of economic activity. The power sector is also projected to witness reduced methane usage owing to a rise in renewable energy generation (RES).

This chapter presents an in-depth evaluation of peak energy demands, particularly methane emissions during periods when natural gas consumption reaches its zenith. By leveraging data from Poland's (PL) various nodes—distinguishing between residential and tertiary sectors—we explore the impact these peaks have on storage strategies needed for maintaining sustainable practices while simultaneously addressing environmental concerns, such as limiting methane emissions.

**Introduction:**  
In response to evolving global energy consumption trends shaped by climate change initiatives, understanding and managing peak demands in Poland's natural gas sector—a notable contributor of the nation’s greenhouse footprint due largely to its significant methane output—is imperative. This analysis probes into how demand response programs influence these peaks during high-energy utilization phases which could potentially heighten environmental issues tied with increased reliance on natural gas for heating and power generation purposes in PL's temperate climate zone.

**Peak Demand Pattern Analysis:**  
Utilizing historical consumption data from the PLEXOS file, we highlight instances like at node PL01Z2RE where a peak demand of 731.92 GWh was recorded during traditionally colder months in Poland—a period characterized by high energy usage and potential storage shortfalls exceeding one gigawatt-hour.

4,4.2,4.2.3,Austria,"In scenarios where heating electrification and maximum wind/solar deployment are prioritized (Distributed Energy), climatic variability significantly impacts electricity system stability due to higher reliance on weather conditions for renewable generation, coupled with decreased dispatchable power sources like nuclear. Conversely, in the Global Ambition scenario where heating electrification is less extensive and wind/solar growth more moderate, climatic effects are somewhat mitigated by a combination of increased flexibility from both consumer-side (PV household batteries & V2G services) and utility-scale storage options.

Figure 30 illustrates the hourly balance in two distinct scenarios for Austria during varying climate conditions experienced throughout different periods within the climatic year 2009:

Distributed Energy Scenario depicts a higher variability as renewable generation is more weather dependent, while Global Ambition shows less fluctuation due to diversified energy sources and increased overall system flexibility. This comparison underscores the need for enhanced operational strategies that account for climatic changes in electricity systems under various electrification levels of heating sectors and renewable capacity expansion rates over time, as both scenarios reflect different degrees of climate-induced variability on demand (heat consumption) and supply sides.

These figures reflect the ambitious decarbonization pathways, contrasting sharply against National Trends' more conservative approach.

The need for system flexibility escalates under varying climatic situations in both deviation scenarios and over time within these graphs of hourly generation profiles during 2-week periods across different countries like Austria:

**Electrification Impacts & Climatic Flexibilities (DE vs. GA):**
The electrification narrative underscores the necessity for flexibility options amidst climatically induced variabilities in power generation systems by 2040 across EU member states, including Austria:

4,4.2,4.2.3,Bulgaria,"In both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios for EU27 by 2040, gas-fired power generation undergoes significant transformation compared to National Trends in electricity supply: its overall capacity remains nearly constant from 2030 onwards as methane capacities are replaced with hydrogen. However, the utilization of this flexibility is reduced due to higher levels of renewable energy sources and short-term storage solutions like residential batteries and V2G services for demand response (Figure 29).

Climatic conditions increasingly impact electricity system adequacy: more variable weather patterns necessitate greater reliance on flexible generation options. In Distributed Energy, this climate dependency is heightened due to heating electrification and maximum wind and solar development—representing the highest climatic exposure (Figures 30).

Focusing specifically on system operation under various climatic situations by demonstrating hourly balance in two-week periods of a typical year, such as for Bulgaria. The graphs illustrate how differing levels of renewable generation capacity and flexibility options like residential batteries or V2G services influence the need for dispatchable power generation (Figure 30).

In conclusion, while maintaining security within supply systems amid varying climatic conditions in electricity system operations by 2040. The Dependency on Climatic Conditions will significantly increase as a result of electrification and evolution of wind & solar capacities across scenarios (Figures provided for Bulgaria). This refined approach emphasizes the need to develop flexibility solutions that address both upstream generation side needs, downstream consumer-side options. These include technologies like residential batteries or V2G services combined with other flexible storage and demand response systems such as electrolysers (see Figure 30 for EU27).

Overall message: As the electricity system becomes more dependent on variable weather conditions due to electrification of heating sector, development in wind & solar capacities will increase. This results not only from a need but also an opportunity with increased climate dependency - Distributed Energy scenario shows higher levels and variety of flexibility options for adequacy compared to Global Ambition (Figure 30).

Despite overall capacities remaining nearly constant from the National Trends scenario into 2050 due to decarbonization efforts on methane and hydrogen sources, their utilization rates are substantially reduced compared to current levels (1689 hours in NT vs. only a few hundred or thousand hours depending on scenarios).

This lower usage is complemented by: 
- High renewable generation capacities driven by storylines that increase beyond minimum capacity available in DE and GA;
- Ample short-term flexibility from residential batteries, vehicle to grid (V2G) services for electric vehicles charging upstream storage, demand side response like electrolysers all expanded as per scenario requirements. 
This combination of high renewable generation capacities alongside extensive development in consumer behavior such as PV connected household batteries and bidirectional V2G service usage results in decreased reliance on dispatchable gas-fired power plants compared to current levels; further reduced with no must run obligations considered within the DE scenario context.

We delve into the implications of phasing out fossil fuels like coal and lignite in favor of renewable energy sources such as wind power.

By 2030, there's a significant shift towards low-carbon generation with an increase from non-binding minimum capacities to higher shares for prosumer behaviors (e.g., residential batteries and V2G services). In Distributed Energy scenarios (DE), we see the highest climatic exposure due to heating electrification coupled with maximum wind power development, alongside a growing consumer flexibility in form of bidirectional electric vehicle charging plus demand side response like jointly expanded electrolysers.

Conversely, Global Ambition projections (GA) present somewhat lesser climatic impacts on the electricity system as compared to DE scenarios.. In addition to that National Trends show a higher reliance on flexibility from dispatchable generation such as nuclear and gas-fired power plants with no must run obligations considered.

The development of prosumer behaviors results in high levels of residential batteries and V2G services providing short -term storage solutions.. Furthermore, the electrification of heating sector combined with ample renewable generation capacity (including nuclear) leads to reduced reliance on thermal power plants above actual observed utilization.

In Distributed Energy scenarios, climatic exposure will be at its highest as a result of high direct electrification and maximum wind development.. Finally, the need for seasonal flexibility by coupling electricity systems with hydrogen infrastructure becomes beneficial to system security under various climate situations in 2-week periods.

This is due to increased variability from both demand and supply sides resulting from direct electrification of heating systems with renewables like wind and solar power experiencing greater fluctuation in availability.

To address this challenge effectively within these scenarios, a comprehensive strategy on system operation under various climatic situations must be deployed:

- In Distributed Energy (DE), where there is more direct electrification of heating systems with variable renewables like wind and solar power experiencing higher fluctuation in availability compared to Global Ambition. Here, the development of residential batteries for short-term storage alongside utility-scale battery services will play a crucial role similar to hydro pump storages..

Here are key points and graphical representations to note about flexibility needs in DE vs Global Ambition scenarios, with emphasis on potential limitations that may affect feasible levels of identified technologies within these reports like TYNDP scenario cycles or other detailed documentation.

   **Electrification Impact**: As the electricity system becomes increasingly dependent on climate conditions due to electrification (heating sector) and maximum wind/solar development, alongside ample short-term flexibility in form of batteries, flexible charging of EVs, demand side response like electrolysers—the greater capacity for renewable generation combined with the flexibility options lead to a reduced reliance on thermal generation.

   **Electrification Impact**: The",Modelling Results,Electricity,Electricity Grid Flows,"The electricity system's reliance on flexibility will significantly increase due to heightened climatic exposure from heating electrification and variable renewable production, alongside decreasing dispatchable generation like nuclear power in scenarios such as Distributed Energy (DE) compared to Global Ambition. In DE, consumer behavior becomes more flexible with a higher adoption of residential batteries for short-term storage solutions complemented by the bidirectional use of electric vehicles and utility-scale energy storage systems similar to hydro pump storages in capacity.

Conversely, while both scenarios exhibit increased flexibility from prosumer behaviors (PV-connected household batteries) as well as V2G services for residential areas. The DE scenario sees a more dynamic consumer behavior with substantial shares of PV-connected home battery storage and bidirectional electric vehicle usage running at the same time, reducing dependence on traditional dispatchable generation sources like hydro pump storages observed in National Trends scenarios.

The greater levels of renewable generation coupled with ample short-term storage options lead to reduced reliance on thermal power. This scenario emphasizes the increasing need for electricity system flexibility as we move towards more variable climates and increased electrification, particularly within residential sectors (PV+H households) where consumer behaviors adaptively provide this much needed hourly balance under various 2-week periods of different climes in year 2009.",Modelling Results,Electricity,Electricity Grid Flows,"In scenarios where heating is electrified and renewable energy sources like wind and solar are maximized (Distributed Energy), the electricity system's exposure to climate conditions will be heightened, necessitating more robust flexibility solutions alongside decreased nuclear generation. This scenario sees a surge in residential battery installations for short-term storage needs and vehicle-to-grid services that support grid stability through bidirectional EV charging/discharging capabilities. Additionally, synthetic fuel production may offer seasonally flexible electricity system solutions by linking the hydrogen infrastructure with electrolysis processes serving as both dispatchable power generation flexibility sources (PV-connected household batteries and V2G services) for adequacy in extreme climatic situations during 2-week periods of various weather conditions.

Conversely, a more moderate climate impact on demand side response options like electrolysers will play into the security strategy differently across two scenarios: Distributed Energy (DE), where heating electrification is maximized and variable renewable production decreases; there's also no must-run obligations considered. In Global Ambition, a scenario with less direct electrification of space heating, more nuclear generation persists alongside an increased need for short -term storage solutions in order to maintain the security of supply as climate conditions significantly influence power system operation under various climatic situations illustrated through graphs showing hourly balance during 2-week periods.

In both Distributed Energy (DE) and Global Ambition (GA), these trends highlight distinct patterns of electricity demand fluctuations influenced by seasonal weather changes:

1. In DE, there's a pronounced increase in flexibility needs to manage the variability caused by stronger wind generation during peak seasons like summer 2009 days with high solar output (right). This scenario also incorporates consumer-driven short-term storage solutions such as residential batteries and V2G services for bidirectional electric vehicle usage.

The graphs provided showcase DE and GA scenarios for Europe within a two-week period. The left graph indicates power generation dynamics specific to Distributed Energy while contrasting with Global Ambition's approach that balances the increased variability in weather patterns against electrification trends, ultimately requiring more system operation (SO) under various climatic situations as part of scenario storylines and flexibility source developments.",Modelling Results,Electricity,Electricity Grid Flows,"In scenarios where heating is electrified and renewable energy sources like wind and solar are maximized (Distributed Energy), we observe a heightened impact of climate variability on electricity system operations compared to situations with more nuclear generation, less variable renewables, additional flexibility in hydrogen infrastructure, and consumer behavior that adapts gradually over time (Global Ambition). Both scenarios emphasize the importance of integrating various forms of flexible power sources:
- In Distributed Energy, there's a notable reliance on residential batteries with PV connections and electric vehicles utilized bidirectionally. The development also includes utility-scale storages alongside hydro pump storage solutions. This illustrates that while direct electrification behaviors are more flexible in terms of using stored power during peak demand times, there's a higher share in Distributed Energy compared to Global Ambition for residential batteries and V2G services providing short-term storage options.

4,4.2,4.2.3,Finland,"In both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios for Europe by 2040, there's a notable shift in power generation dynamics due to climatic factors impacting renewable sources like wind and solar energy as well as heating electrification trends. Here are key points reflecting these changes:

1. **Climate-Driven Electricity System Challenges**: The variability of weather conditions, influenced by global warming, has a profound effect on the availability and predictability of wind and solar power generation levels across Europe's countries—such as Finland in Figure 30 (assuming it references different climatic situations).

2. **Electrification Impact**: With more direct electrification for heating purposes, there is increased climate dependency within the electricity system. This underscores a need to develop and deploy various flexibility solutions as part of maintaining supply security under diverse weather conditions (e.g., during cold snaps).

3. **Flexible Consumer Behaviors**: In contrast with National Trends, both deviation scenarios reveal an uptick in prosumer-driven short-term storage options such as household batteries and V2G services for grid support within a 2-week climatic year frame based on data from Finland.

4. **Dispatchable Generation Decline**: As the share of direct electrification grows, there's an observable decrease in reliance upon dispatched thermal power generation (including nuclear) compared to National Trends scenario for Europe by 2040. This reflects a broader systemic shift towards more flexible and less predictable energy sources that must be managed with innovative solutions like residential batteries, bidirectional EV usage including V2G services, electrolysers, hydrogen storage systems to ensure the adequacy of supply under varying climatic conditions.

This refined message emphasizes a future Europe where climate considerations are at the forefront in managing an increasingly electrified and variable power generation landscape by 2040 across multiple scenarios including Distributed Energy, Global Ambition for Europe as detailed above while maintaining core messages intact.",Modelling Results,Electricity,Electricity Grid Flows,"The analysis indicates that climate variability significantly impacts electricity system operations in both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios compared to National Trends by 2040 due to increased electrification of heating, greater reliance on wind and solar energy sources for direct generation. To ensure security of supply under different climatic conditions:

1. In the **Distributed Energy** scenario, there is a higher demand for flexibility because this model assumes extensive deployment of renewable resources (like residential batteries) alongside increased electrification in heating and transportation sectors using bidirectional electric vehicles (EVs). The presence of seasonally flexible storage solutions further enhances the system's adaptability to climate-induced variability.
    * **Distributed Energy** scenario shows a greater development of prosumer behaviors, including higher shares in Distributed Energy for residential batteries and V2G services providing short-term flexibility. Utility-scale batteries are used similarly as hydro pump storages but also illustrate the need to produce synthetic fuels (via electrolysis) which offers seasonal storage solutions beneficial for system security under various climatic situations in Finland during 2049, according to a storyline that expects increased climate exposure.
    
In contrast:
- **National Trends** show higher reliance on dispatchable generation like nuclear power plants (NPPs), which decrease flexibility needs over time as the electrification of heating and evolution in wind/solar capacities lower direct thermal energy production shares compared to Distributed Energy. There is also a reduced need for flexible charging services from electric vehicles (EV-FC) due to less variable renewable output, suggesting that dispatchability options will see decreased utilization as the climatic exposure of both scenarios intensifies relative to National Trends by 2049 under Finnish analysis.

In summary: The **Distributed Energy** scenario underscores a significant increase in operational challenges due to heightened climate variability, necessitating robust and diversified flexibility sources for the adequacy of Europe's electricity system (EU27). This includes an emphasis on residential battery storage options alongside utility-scale batteries. The development is also supported by bidirectional usage services from EV charging combined with expanded electrolysers"
4,4.2,4.2.3,France,"In scenarios with increased electrification for heating and more extensive deployment of wind and solar power generation (as seen in Distributed Energy), alongside a reduction in dispatchable sources like nuclear, there is an amplified need to manage electricity system variability due to changing weather conditions. The development of prosumer behaviors leads to widespread adoption of residential batteries and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) services for short-term storage solutions. Additionally, synthetic fuel production—coupled with the hydrogen infrastructure in both scenarios—provides seasonal flexibility by integrating electricity and hydrogen systems more effectively than under milder climatic conditions seen in Global Ambition scenario. These findings underscore that as climate exposure rises due to heating electrification, wind variability decrease somewhat when compared between Distributed Energy (DE) and a less variable Renewable Power Generation capacity within the same year 2009 under different climatic conditions scenarios in France for illustrative purposes.",Modelling Results,Electricity,Electricity Grid Flows,"In both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios for EU27 by 2040, gas-fired power generation undergoes significant changes compared to National Trends due to a shift towards low carbon sources like biomethane and synthetic methane. Although the installed capacities of these plants remain nearly constant from 2030 until 2050 as they are replaced by hydrogen-fired power stations, their role in providing flexibility during periods with limited renewable generation is critical.

Several factors contribute to this reduced reliance on thermal generators:
1. High levels of variable wind and solar production capacity across Distributed Energy (DE) scenarios due to ample short-term storage options like residential batteries, V2G services from electric vehicles, demand side response via expanded electrolysers providing both generation flexibility as well as fuel security during times when direct electrification is not feasible.

Figure 30 illustrates the hourly balance in two week periods of climatic year 2009 under different circumstances:
                            Country: France
                            
The increased need for system operation flexibility due to varying weather conditions and higher levels of renewable generation capacity compared to National Trends scenarios is evident. In Distributed Energy, the greater development of wind power as well as residential batteries with bidirectional usage by electric vehicles are lowering dependency on thermal gas-fired plants (see Figure 29).

In contrast to DE and GA showing reduced reliance compared to National Trends scenario for EU27 due to ample short-term storage options like expanded electrolysers providing both generation flexibility as well as fuel security during times when direct electrification is not feasible (see Figure 30).

4,4.2,4.2.3,Greece,"In this analysis, we explore how climate conditions impact electricity system operations in Europe by comparing two scenarios with varying levels of renewable energy integration and electrification - Distributed Energy (DE) and Global Ambition (GA). The climatic year 2009 serves as a reference for understanding the demand-supply balance during extreme weather events.

This comparative study between the two scenarios demonstrates that as Europe integrates more renewable energy sources and electrifies sectors like heating, it will face greater variability in electricity system operations due to changing weather conditions. In contrast with National Trends showing a higher reliance on dispatchable generation (including nuclear), DE scenario exhibits lower levels of conventional power plants alongside the development of prosumer behaviors and flexibility options such as residential batteries, V2G services, utility-scale batteries, bidirectional usage electric vehicles.

Furthermore, Global Ambition shows a more flexible consumer behavior with higher shares in Distributed Energy compared to Global Ambition.. In addition to that utility-scale batteries are used in the same order of magnitude as hydro pump storages... Finally, the need for seasonal flexibility by coupling electricity and hydrogen systems may also offer additional storage solutions.

Both DE and GA show a greater reliance on consumer-side flexibility solutions like residential batteries with PV integration and bidirectional electric vehicle usage than National Trends do. Utility-scale battery storage is employed similarly across both scenarios, although at levels comparable to hydro pump storages in terms of capacity for system adequacy during distinct 2-week periods within the climatic year 2009 framework."
4,4.2,4.2.3,Croatia,"In alignment with climate variations and increasing electrification in heating alongside enhanced wind and solar capacity, system operation faces heightened challenges for maintaining energy security within EU27 regions like Croatia during different climatic periods of a typical year (referencing the data from 2009). The scenarios Distributed Energy and Global Ambition illustrate how these conditions necessitate diverse strategies to ensure adequate electricity supply.

Figure 30 compares hourly generation profiles under two climate-sensitive circumstances: one reflecting standard weather patterns (left), which may experience increased variability in renewable output due to more extreme climatic events on the right side of the graph. Both scenarios emphasize a greater need for system flexibility, as direct electrification shifts demand from dispatchable power sources like nuclear generation and hydro pump storage solutions - similar capacities highlighted across both Distributed Energy (DE) and Global Ambition (GA).

In contrast to National Trends' reliance on traditional thermal generators in addition to must-run obligations, the DE scenario showcases a robust development of prosumer technologies such as PV-connected household batteries and bidirectional V2G services. These short-term storage solutions are crucial for addressing immediate supply gaps caused by climatic conditions - with Distributed Energy scenarios showing even higher adoption rates among consumers (e.g., residential EVs, demand side response including electrolysers).

Simultaneously in Global Ambition cases, there's a balanced mix of upstream flexibility from generation-side resources and downstream consumer behavior - exemplified by the development trajectories for PV household batteries as well as bidirectional EV utilization. These varied sources contribute to system adequacy during different climatic situations within Croatia, highlighting how a portfolio approach combining both dispatchable power (including nuclear) generation and flexible demand-side responses is essential in maintaining the security of supply under varying weather conditions throughout 2009's hourly balance data.

The implication here for system operation strategies - particularly as we consider potential limitations on flexibility options like batteries or V2G services, with a thorough examination due to be undertaken in upcoming TYNDP scenario cycles and other reports such as the ERAA (focus)",Modelling Results,Electricity,Electricity Grid Flows,"In both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios for EU27 by 2040, gas-fired power generation undergoes significant changes compared to National Trends due to a shift towards decarbonized methane (including biomethane) and hydrogen. The installed capacities of these plants remain almost constant from 2030 till 2050 as they replace each other, serving primarily for flexibility during periods with low renewable energy generation availability due to weather conditions or peak demand times.

The high levels of direct electrification in heating sectors and the maximum development potential for wind (Wind) and solar photovoltaics (PV-connected household batteries, V2G services etc.) result in a reduced reliance on thermal generation which is less climate exposed compared to Distributed Energy.

In contrast with National Trends showing higher utilization of dispatchable generation like nuclear power plants.. 

The electrification of the heating sector and development of wind (Wind) and solar photovoltaics in both deviation scenarios show a different usage pattern over time, reflecting changes due to climatic conditions. In Distributed Energy where direct space-heating is fully decarbonized by prosumer behaviors like residential batteries V2G services providing short term storage solutions..

In Global Ambition with less variable renewable production and more nuclear generation showing a higher share in hydrogen demand via electrolysis, the need for flexibility from dispatchable power plants decreases relatively slower both on the demand (e.g., heating electrification) and supply side due to lower levels of wind energy development compared to Distributed Energy..

The influence of climatic conditions on the electricity system will significantly increase as a result of space-heating direct electrification evolution, along with increased variability in weather patterns impacting renewable generation. This leads to an enhanced role for flexibility sources like batteries and residential V2G services providing short -term storage solutions..

Furthermore, the development of prosumer behaviors will result in a high deployment rate of PV-connected household batteries (see Figure 29)) and bidirectional usage of electric vehicles to offer both generation side upstream flexibility needs as well as downstream consumer behavior consumption solutions.

In DE, which anticipates a higher degree of direct electricity use in heating alongside the most ambitious renewable deployment rates including substantial growth in residential battery storage through PV installations. This scenario envisions robust consumer-level flexibility with bidirectional EV charging and significant demand response from electrolysers, all contributing to a high degree of climatic exposure for electricity system adequacy (Fig 29).

The GA contrasts by assuming less direct electrification in heating compared to DE. It also projects lower variability renewable production rates and more pronounced nuclear generation reliance than the DE scenario, all while maintaining a higher degree of consumer flexibility including utility-scale batteries coupled with hydrogen infrastructure for seasonal storage solutions (Fig 30 - Hourly balance in two weeks periods).

These insights underscore Europe's evolving electricity system dynamics under varied climatic situations, as delineated through refined hourly generation profiles of power systems within DE and GA scenarios.",Modelling Results,Electricity,Electricity Grid Flows,"In scenarios where climate variability has a pronounced impact on electricity generation due to high levels of direct electrification for heating and extensive deployment of wind and solar power, Distributed Energy shows increased flexibility requirements compared to Global Ambition. This is driven by less reliance on dispatchable sources like nuclear energy in the former scenario and greater development of prosumer behaviors such as residential batteries and V2G services that provide short-term storage solutions (Figure 30).

The climatic exposure will be highest under Distributed Energy, where a combination of direct electrification for heating and maximum wind and solar capacity necessitates more advanced flexibility strategies. Utility-scale batteries are anticipated to follow the same growth trajectory as hydro pump storage facilities (Figure 29).

Conversely, Global Ambition scenarios will experience a relatively slower increase in climatic impact on both supply and demand sides of the electric system due to factors such as reduced direct electrification rates, less variable renewable energy production, increased nuclear generation capacity, more adaptable hydrogen infrastructure. This results in lower flexibility needs compared to Distributed Energy (Figure 30).

The difference between these scenarios emphasizes that while the need for system operation resilience under various climatic conditions will grow over time due to electrification and renewables expansion, there are significant differences regarding consumer-side behaviors. The development of both upstream flexibility solutions (like residential batteries) on generation side as well as downstream options such as bidirectional vehicle usage is projected differently across the scenarios with Distributed Energy showing more aggressive growth in these areas compared to Global Ambition, thereby highlighting a critical aspect for ensuring energy system security and adequacy (Figure 29).

Further analysis will be conducted on potential constraints affecting flexibility options' feasibility through upcoming TYNDP scenario cycles as well as other reports such as the ERAA. This underscores a broader narrative that electrification and renewable deployment must advance hand-in-hand with robust, diverse energy system operation strategies to maintain supply security amidst increasing climatic uncertainties (Figure 30)."
4,4.2,4.2.3,Italy,"In both scenarios – Distributed Energy and Global Ambition by 2040 – gas-fired power generation plays a pivotal role in ensuring flexibility, particularly during periods when renewable energy output is low due to insufficient sun or wind conditions. While the overall capacity of these plants remains relatively stable from 2030 onwards, their utilization shifts significantly compared to National Trends by that year: a decrease ranging between -85% and -96%.

This change in gas-fired power generation's role is due primarily to two factors within the Distributed Energy (DE) scenario. Firstly, both scenarios feature high levels of renewable energy production capacity – beyond what National Trends would suggest as a minimum available level for DE. Secondly, ample short-term flexibility options are expanded in these deviation pathways compared with national trends by that year: Distributed Energy shows the highest climatic exposure and reliance on upstream gas generation to answer adequacy of its electricity system under various climate situations – between scenarios as well as over time.

Furthermore, due consideration for potential limitations impacting feasibility will be thoroughly examined in forthcoming TYNDP scenario cycles alongside other reports like the ERAA.",Modelling Results,Electricity,Electricity Grid Flows,"In both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios for EU27 by 2040, gas-fired power generation plays a critical role in providing flexibility during periods of low renewable energy output. While methane-powered plants see significant capacity reductions compared to the National Trends scenario (ranging from -85% to -96% between 2030 and 2040), hydrogen facilities are expected to compensate, maintaining overall gas power plant capacities nearly constant.

This shift towards flexibility is driven by several key factors:

1. High levels of renewable energy capacity in Distributed Energy (DE) combined with ample short-term storage options like residential batteries and vehicle-to-grid services, reducing reliance on thermal generation. The greater availability of renewable sources compared to National Trends scenario represents the minimum capacities available for DE.
   
2. In Global Ambition scenarios (GA), while heating sector electrification reduces capacity further (-96% reduction in methane plants between 2030 and 2040)), a higher share of hydrogen demand via electrolysis, coupled with ample short-term flexibility options including battery storage from PV systems (see Figure 28) as well as flexible charging services for electric vehicles like expanded residential batteries or V2G solutions providing seasonal and long-term storage needs.
   
3. The development of prosumer behaviors resulting in a high deployment rate of household batteries, bidirectional usage of EVs (including jointly deployed electrolysers as demand side response), alongside other flexibility options like ample short-term battery capacity and flexible charging services for electric vehicles acting together to expand the capacities available.

The visualization highlights how varying weather conditions influence renewable power generation from wind and solar sources within these climate-resilient frameworks aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 under different energy transition pathways (ETP).

In the Distributed Energy scenario, we see a more aggressive shift towards localized electricity production. This includes residential batteries and vehicle-to-grid services for immediate storage solutions.. Additionally to that utility-scale batteries are used in comparable capacities as hydro pump storages demonstrate their role within Lithuania's two-week climatic year analysis of 2009 weather patterns.

In the Global Ambition scenario, we observe a balanced integration strategy between renewables and dispatched power sources (including nuclear).

This refined version retains all essential technical details while presenting the impact of changing weather patterns on renewable energy production within two distinct future scenarios aimed at achieving climate neutrality by 2050 in Lithuania, as part of broader European decarbonization efforts detailed for both ETP.
",Modelling Results,Electricity,Electricity Grid Flows,"In both deviation scenarios from National Trends by 2040, methane and hydrogen-fired power generation capacities are nearly constant; however, their utilization drops significantly due to increased renewable energy penetration providing flexibility during periods of low wind or solar output. This shift results in fewer full load hours for these gas plants compared to 2040 levels under National Trends (87 and 1689 respectively), with only a small number operating simultaneously across all scenarios, highlighting the critical role they play in balancing supply against high renewable generation capacities.

The electrification of heating contributes less directly to this narrative but supports the underlying theme: As more wind or solar energy is harnessed into Europe's power grid (2035-169), a smaller number of gas plants must still offer short-term flexibility for system adequacy.

Figure 30 illustrates hourly generation profiles under various climatic conditions, using Lithuania as an example region within the European Union's broader energy context analysis presented in this detailed report excerpt and graphical data interpretation summary (2040 scenarios)."
4,4.2,4.2.3,Luxembourg,"In alignment with various scenarios, including Distributed Energy and Global Ambition by 2040, wind capacity exhibits a strong demand in onshore installations (matching distributed energy needs) but shows slightly lower requirements for solar capacities compared to National Trends. The offshore wind scenario differences between deviation pathways are less marked due to compliance with non-binding minimum generation targets set by the MS's Non-Binding Agreement.

By 2030 and extending into 2040, renewable energy sources (RES), particularly nuclear power which is expected in national trends but slightly lower there like Luxembourg) are projected to decrease reliance on dispatchable generation technologies such as hydro pump storage systems – akin across scenarios.

The climatic impact will be heightened by heating sector electrification and maximum wind/solar development, particularly under Distributed Energy conditions where consumer behavior also contributes flexibility through residential batteries (PV-connected household battery) and vehicle to grid services that provide both short-term storage solutions on the generation side as well as longer duration energy system balancing from downstream consumers.

The need for operational adaptability in response to climatic variations will escalate, with a parallel increase in electrification of heating alongside an upsurge in renewable power capacity – surpassing minimum levels available under National Trends scenarios by 2040. This demonstrates the criticality and proliferation potential for short-term flexibility technologies (e.g., electrolysers, joint expansion) to maintain system adequacy amidst rising climate exposure across both deviation pathways in Distributed Energy versus Global Ambition scenarios by 2040.

This shift occurs because:

1. The installed capacities are determined to be equivalent between scenarios and electricity/gas Transmission System Operators (TSOs), with Distributed Energy setting higher levels due to optimized renewable generation from 2030 onwards, which reduces reliance on thermal plants such as in National Trends scenario that sets the minimum capacity available.
   
   The high capacities for wind and solar power combined with short-term flexibility options like residential batteries (PVs) and vehicle-to-grid services provided by flexible charging of electric vehicles (EVs), including demand side response via electrolysers, decrease the reliance on thermal generation.
   
   Furthermore, no must run obligations are considered in these scenarios, which could lead to higher utilization levels for gas power plants if such requirements or additional revenue streams were included as per scenario storylines but also noted that potential limitations of flexibility options will be further examined. 

Focus on system operation under various climatic situations: The influence of climate conditions increases with direct electrification in the heating sector and maximum wind and solar production development, especially observed in Distributed Energy scenarios due to higher levels of renewable generation capacity combined with ample short-term flexibility options like residential batteries (PVs) and vehicle-to-grid services provided by flexible charging of electric vehicles (EVs). The extent of the flexibility needs increases as well, requiring a broader range of technologies to maintain system adequacy under various climatic situations.

4,4.2,4.2.3,Latvia,"The climate's impact on electricity systems is set to intensify due to increased electrification of heating and higher variability in wind and solar energy production, necessitating enhanced flexibility for system adequacy across scenarios like Distributed Energy and Global Ambition. In these projections:

- **Distributed Energy** sees more pronounced climatic effects with a significant rise in both demand from electric heating and supply variability due to wind/solar, leading to higher dependence on dispatchable power generation (including nuclear) alongside residential battery adoption and V2G services. Synthetic fuel production also emerges as an option for seasonal flexibility by integrating the electricity and hydrogen systems more comprehensively over time compared with National Trends or Global Ambition scenarios which rely less on dispatchable generation due to different levels of direct electrification, wind/solar variability reduction strategies (like increased residential batteries usage), utility-scale battery adoption similar in magnitude as pump storage and more flexible charging services for EVs.
  
  **Global Ambition** experiences a slower increase in climatic impact on the electricity system, with less direct electrification of space heating (and thus higher variability from wind/solar) alongside increased nuclear generation reliance compared to Distributed Energy scenarios which see more pronounced climatic effects.

Specifically, these examples use Latvia as a reference point for geographical context in assessments or projections related to climate impacts and energy systems adequacy under different scenarios (Distributed Energy vs Global Ambition).
",Modelling Results,Electricity,Electricity Grid Flows,"In alignment with climate variations during a typical climatic year in 2009 and considering different scenarios such as Distributed Energy (DE) and Global Ambition, we observe distinct hourly power generation profiles for Latvia:

- **Distributed Energy Scenario** shows increased variability aligned with higher shares of direct electrification from renewable sources. This leads to greater fluctuations in the balance between supply and demand due to intermittent wind and solar energy production, necessitating more adaptive strategies for maintaining grid stability during periods of climatic stress (left side graph).
  
- **Global Ambition Scenario** indicates a moderated impact on hourly generation profiles. With less direct electrification relative to DE, coupled with higher nuclear power output and enhanced flexibility in hydrogen infrastructure management, Latvia experiences more consistent electricity supply patterns amidst climatic conditions (right side graph).
  
These reflections highlight the evolving need for robust system operation under diverse climate situations. The graphs underscore that as renewable energy penetration grows and direct electrification of heating expands, systems must become increasingly responsive to weather-induced variability in power generation while also managing consumer flexibility through residential batteries and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services.

Simultaneously, natural gas (NG) as a fuel for thermal generation is projected to decline sharply under the storyline of both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios compared with National Trends where no must run obligations are considered.

Under these changing conditions:

4,4.2,4.2.3,Poland,"The evolution of gas-fired power plant capacities and their role in electricity generation are significantly altered between National Trends, Distributed Energy (DE), and Global Ambition scenarios by 2040:

In DE and GA compared to NT for EU27 from 2030 onwards:
- Methane fired power plant capacities decline sharply (-85% in DE & -96% in GA vs. a minor drop of about 11% in the National Trends scenario). These reductions reflect increased reliance on renewable generation and consumer flexibility options, including prosumer behaviors such as PV-connected household batteries (more prevalent in DE) and bidirectional electric vehicle usage to provide short-term storage solutions.
- Synthetic fuel production for replacing imports may offer seasonal system integration by linking the electrical and hydrogen infrastructure, adding another layer of flexibility. 

The need for dispatchable power generation also decreases in DE (-75% vs. National Trends) due to higher renewable capacities complemented with a variety of flexible technologies (batteries, EV charging/discharging via V2G services). In contrast:
- NT scenario shows more reliance on dispatchable generation like nuclear power for system adequacy. 

Over time and under different climatic exposures in DE vs GA scenarios from the year 2040, there will be an increased need to develop a broader range of technologies:
- Both deviation scenarios necessitate heightened flexibility as renewables like wind and solar become more variable due to climate change. This includes upstream (generation side) options such as utility scale batteries with capacities roughly equivalent to hydro pump storage, flexible charging services for electric vehicles on the residential level, industrial-scale electrolysis coupled with seasonal flexibility through synthetic fuels production and advanced long-term energy solutions like underground or offshore geological CO2 sequestration.

4,4.2,4.2.3,Portugal,"In both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios for EU27 by 2040, gas-fired power generation evolves significantly compared to National Trends in terms of capacity utilization due to high levels of renewable energy deployment and increased flexibility options. The installed capacities remain constant from the baseline scenario (National Trends) into Distributed Energy or Global Ambition scenarios up until 2050, but their role shifts towards providing system flexibility during periods with low generation from wind and solar power:

1. Increased Renewable Generation Capacity in DE/GA surpasses baseline (National Trends). This is due to ample short-term storage solutions such as residential batteries, flexible charging of electric vehicles (EVs), demand side response like electrolysers and prosumer behaviours.
   
The greater capacity for renewable generation in DE/GA combined with the flexibility options leads to a reduced reliance on thermal power plants above actual levels observed due to no must run obligations considered within these scenarios but also examined further in upcoming TYNDP scenario cycles and other reports like ERAA.

The influence of climatic conditions will significantly increase as more direct electrification (heating sector) along with maximum wind and solar development are introduced by the storyline. Beyond hydro pump storage which capacity follows the same path, Distributed Energy shows a higher demand for flexibility from dispatchable generation due to lesser reliance on residential batteries in combination with more ample of short-term (e.g., utility scale batteries) and downstream options - between scenarios as well as over time:

1. High levels of renewable energy capacity combined with the development of flexibility solutions like jointly expanded electrolysers, bidirectional usage of electric vehicles via V2G services providing short-term storage (e.g., utility scale batteries) and residential PVs connected household batteries increase overall system resilience to climatic exposure while maintaining security of supply through the development of technologies to meet flexibility needs under various climatic situations:

4,4.2,4.2.3,Romania,"In both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios for EU27 by 2040, there's a noticeable shift in electricity generation profiles due to varying climatic conditions during specific periods of the year (using Romania as an example). Compared with National Trends:

- In Distribution Scenarios (DE), power demand and supply from renewables like wind and solar are more variable, requiring greater use of system flexibility. This is reflected in hourly generation profiles that show significant fluctuations during peak seasons or weather events due to the higher penetration rates for direct heating electrification needs.
- In Global Ambition (GA), although there's increased variability from renewables, overall need and utilization of flexibility are more moderate than in DE scenarios. This is evident when examining hourly generation profiles; both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition show a higher reliance on upstream flexibility options like residential batteries (PV-connected household batteries) and vehicle to grid services for short term storage solutions, compared with National Trends which represent the minimum capacity available.

The electrification of space heating combined with less direct renewable production results in a lower need for dispatchable power generation as observed under different climatic situations (like Romania). Additionally:

- The development of prosumer behaviors, such as higher shares in Distributed Energy compared to Global Ambition scenarios. This includes more flexibility from residential batteries and V2G services providing short -term storage solutions alongside the growth of utility-scale batteries used at a similar order magnitude as hydro pump storages (see Figure 30).
  
These findings underscore that, under various climatic situations with increased climate dependency on electricity systems:

1. The need for flexibility will increase and require the development of different technologies to meet it effectively while maintaining security of supply within Distributed Energy (DE) scenarios compared to Global Ambition (GA). 
2. Focus should be placed not only on system operation but also under various climatic situations, highlighting that potential limitations impacting feasibility must thoroughly examine in upcoming TYNDP scenario cycles and other reports like the ERAA..",Modelling Results,Electricity,Electricity Grid Flows,"In both deviation scenarios—Distributed Energy and Global Ambition for EU27 by 2040—there's a marked shift in gas-fired power generation from traditional methane sources to predominantly hydrogen, reflecting the broader decarbonization trend. This transition is driven not only by policy but also by technological advancements and market dynamics:

1. **Installed Capacity Alignment** - While both scenarios start with similar installed capacities for gas-fired power plants as in National Trends, their evolution diverges significantly due to increased renewable energy capacity (PVs and wind) alongside the development of flexible consumer behavior through prosumer behaviors like PV-connected household batteries.

2. **Renewables Expansion** - The electrification of heating in Distributed Energy is coupled with a substantial rise in renewable generation capacity, thanks to higher levels of wind and solar power compared to National Trends scenario which represents the minimum available capacity under these scenarios. This results from ample short-term flexibility options being expanded (jointly developed) electrolysers for demand side response like hydrogen storage providing seasonal flexibility by coupling electricity and hydrogen systems as part of a broader strategy that includes utility-scale batteries, bidirectional usage of EVs with V2G services offering short -term storage solutions.

3. **Consumer Flexibility** - Both scenarios showcase an increased reliance on upstream flexibility (generation side) and downstream flexibility (consumer side), further illustrating the impact of global warming on weather conditions variability, necessitating greater development in technologies to meet these increasing requirements.

4. **Security Investment** - Beyond just capacity adjustments between scenarios as well as over time due to different storyline considerations (e.g., must run obligations or additional revenue streams), there's a focus on system operation under various climatic situations, demonstrating the enhanced need for flexibility in response to both demand and supply side adaptability challenges posed by climate exposure increases as electrification of space-heating evolves.

4,4.2,4.2.3,Sweden,"In both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios for EU27 in 2040, methane-fired power generation sees a significant decrease compared to National Trends by -85% to -96%, while hydrogen production rises substantially. This transition aligns with the European Union's phase-out policies on coal and lignite from electricity markets starting in 2030, driven primarily by high CO2 prices at a continental level.

The overall capacity of gas power plants remains almost stable between National Trends and deviation scenarios; however, increased renewable generation (from electrolysis) leads to higher levels compared with the base scenario under DE or GA storylines without must-run obligations assumed in these alternative projections for TYNDP.

The need for system flexibility becomes crucial as we expect more extreme weather conditions due to global warming impact on renewable energy variability (wind and solar). The Distributed Energy scenario, with its greater deployment of both generation side (gas-fired) capacity and downstream consumer flexibilities like residential batteries and V2G services.

In contrast, the Global Ambition case shows less climatic exposure than DE on demand but also supply sides due to direct electrification in heating sectors along with maximum winds/solar scenarios development over time leading ultimately resulting into a higher share of flexibility from dispatchable generation (including nuclear) being lowered.

In Distributed Energy (DE), which anticipates higher direct electrification in heating and a substantial increase in wind power production capacity at any given time, the need for system flexibility is evident. DE showcases residential batteries becoming more prevalent as well as greater utilization of V2G services by electric vehicles to provide short-term storage solutions (see Figure 30).

Conversely, Global Ambition scenarios suggest a relatively slower increase in both demand and supply sides due to less direct electrification. Here too Sweden's hourly generation profiles for two weeks during the climatic year of 2009 under DE scenario serve as clear evidence: Climate conditions will significantly influence Europe’s electricity system by increasing its climate dependency (see Figure 31).

These insights underscore that, amidst a transition towards renewable-centric energy systems in Sweden's context, climatic variability emerges as an essential factor. The DE and GA scenarios collectively highlight the evolving landscape of system operation under various climate circumstances by midcentury 2040 (see Figure 31).

4,4.4,4.4.1,summary,"In both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios, by 2050 we anticipate substantial growth in electrolyzer capacity within Europe's hydrogen sector, aiming for nearly 400 GW of installed power across distributed networks or a global supply system. This expansion is primarily fueled by the increasing utilization of renewable energy sources (RES), which are integrated into local and regional grids as well as through dedicated infrastructure designed to connect directly with hydrogen production sites, thereby mitigating any need for additional electricity grid expansions.

The transition away from grey hydrogen entails a phasing out approach where current small-scale or non-CCS (carbon capture and storage) facilities are either decommissioned, retrofitted with CCS technology by 2030 in countries that have such strategies established, replaced entirely within the Distributed Energy scenario. By contrast, Global Ambition expects only a minimal residual presence of SMR/ATR equipped with carbon capture (5 TWh) towards its mid-century mark.

Hydrogen's role extends beyond power generation; it is pivotal in enhancing system flexibility amidst the unpredictable nature of renewables, addressing both peak and baseload demands as well as accommodating temperature fluctuations for heating applications or weather-dependent supply from electrolyzers.

While various sources like SMR/ATR facilities, e-fuels production sites, import terminals, demand response mechanisms offer flexibility to balance the hydrogen market's dynamic nature by 2050—with a need for upwards of 180 TWh in working gas volume per annum—the current modeling suggests that storage solutions currently outperform these alternatives. Conventional production and international imports are expected only marginally contribute to this flexibility, indicating the potential underestimation of hydrogen storage requirements by as much as a factor nine compared with scenario projections for different future landscapes in Europe's energy systems.

The need for robust connections between countries is highlighted alongside climate variability concerns which could further intensify these demands on strategic and technically feasible storage solutions, underscoring the criticality of optimizing hydrogen infrastructure to ensure a resilient low-carbon future across Europe's energy",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Production Capacities,"In this analysis, we explore how electrolyzers contribute significantly to Europe's decarbonized hydrogen supply by leveraging renewable energy sources (RES). By 2050, it is anticipated that close to 400 GW of electrical capacity will be dedicated solely for the production of green and low-carbon hydrogen. The wholesale electricity market emerges as a dominant force in this landscape due to its reliance on periods where renewable energy generation exceeds demand, offering economical conditions suitable for electrolyzer operation.

Electrolyzers utilize RES available near consumption points or connect directly with existing hydrogen infrastructure (either hybridized using nearby RE sources and the wholesale grid—referred to as ""Dedicated Renewables""—or without expanding local grids). The transition away from grey hydrogen production is expected by 2050, in line with strategies that incorporate carbon capture storage (CCS) for SMR/ATR plants.

The future of Europe's energy system will necessitate enhanced flexibility to accommodate fluctuations between renewable supply and demand patterns—a challenge amplified by the variable nature of hydrogen production through electrolyzers, influenced both seasonally (demand for heating) and daily/hourly based on weather conditions.

While certain existing sources like SMRs with CCS or imports can provide some degree of system flexibility in a transitional phase towards 2050's fully decarbonized hydrogen network, it is clear that substantial storage capacity will be required to ensure balance within the marketplace as well as for managing extreme weather events and geographical limitations.

The current models may understate this need; however, given technological constraints related both economically (the cost of establishing extensive new infrastructure) and logistically (such as varying physical connectivity between regions), it is likely that hydrogen storage capacity will have to be significantly expanded beyond what these preliminary estimates suggest. To achieve the envisioned level of flexibility, which could reach upwards of 180 TWh by mid-century in scenarios like Global Ambition (GA25) or Distributed Energy System Transformation and Integration into Power Systems (""DESTI""), a comprehensive invest"

Executive Summary (Revised): Hydrogen's Role in Europe’s Clean Energy Transition by 2050

- **EU Electrolyser Capacity**: By the year 2050, electrolysers are projected to reach a capacity close to 400 GW within the EU. This marks significant growth as both decarbonized electricity sources and renewable hydrogen imports become integral parts of our energy supply mix—accounting for an import share of nearly one-third (981 TWh) out of total demand, which will be met primarily through electrolysis powered by the wholesale market.
  
  **Strategic Electrolyser Development**: The majority of this capacity is sourced from renewable electricity—either directly via hybrid RES (Renewables at Resource Site) or dedicated to hydrogen production without grid expansion, depending on local resource availability and demand patterns.
  
- **Phasing Out Grey Hydrogen**: The transition plan mandates the complete cessation of grey hydrogen by 2050 through either decommissioning existing SMR/ATR (Small Modular Reactors) without CCS, retrofitting with carbon capture and storage or replacing them entirely. Countries will follow their national strategies to ensure all current facilities are equipped for low-carbon hydrogen production in line by 2030 at the latest under a Global Ambition scenario framework.
  
- **Flexibility Needs of Hydrogen Systems**: As we move towards an increasingly variable energy landscape, our focus on flexibility becomes paramount—particularly for balancing supply and demand throughout daily cycles (peak times). The current system relies heavily not just on hydrogen storage but also a variety other sources such as e-fuels production, strategic import terminals, alongside more dynamic options like demand side response.
  
  **Underestimation of Storage Requirements**: Despite these diverse flexibility resources at play by mid-century (2050), our models suggest an undercurrent",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Production,"In this TYNDP 2024 scenario analysis, we project a significant role for hydrogen in Europe's energy landscape by 2050:

- **Global Hydrogen Demand**: By that time, the demand is expected to reach around 867 terawatt hours (TWh). This includes not only domestic consumption but also imports of renewable and low carbon hydrogen. Currently contributing about one third with an import share of nearly 33%, these clean energy-derived hydrogens are essential for maintaining supply adequacy across the EU, offering close to 981 TWh from imported sources by year's end in our Global Ambition scenario (GA).
  
- **Electrolyser Capacity Expansion**: The proliferation of electrolysers is crucial for producing green hydrogen and synthetic fuels. Our models predict a near doubling to nearly 400 gigawatts by midcentury, predominantly powered by low marginal-cost wholesale electricity from renewable sources like wind or solar farms (81% in both scenarios). These electrolysers are strategically positioned either nearby RES for hybrid setups that utilize local resources efficiently without necessitating extensive grid expansion, known as 'Dedicated RE' installations.
  
- **Decarbonization Path**: The transition phase sees a phasing out of grey hydrogen production by 2050 through either retrofitting with carbon capture and storage (CCS) or replacing older small modular reactors/large coal plants ('SMR / ATR') entirely. In alignment with EU's climate strategies, these facilities are expected to be fully converted for low-carbon operations by 2030 where applicable.
  
- **Flexibility and Storage**: The hydrogen system will increasingly face imbalances between supply (primarily driven by electrolysers) and demand due to intermittent renewable sources, variable temperature demands in heating applications, or electricity peaks requiring dispatchable power generation. Hydrogen storage emerges as a critical solution for this flexibility challenge—current salt caverns are utilized while potential solutions like depleted gas fields present technical hurdles yet hold promise at scale.
  "
4,4.4,4.4.3,Austria,"By 2050, Europe's transition to a clean energy system will heavily rely on hydrogen as both an electricity supply source and for heating applications, necessitating significant storage capacity due to its variable demand profile driven by weather patterns and temperature fluctuations. The European Union (EU) recognizes the strategic importance of importing renewable hydrogen from global sources while developing a robust electrolysis infrastructure powered predominantly by low-cost, surplus electricity generated during periods of high RES generation availability or when wholesale prices are at their lowest.

The EU's ambitious clean energy targets highlight an increase in hydrogen production capacity to nearly 400 GW through electrolysis facilities powered by renewable sources, with a substantial portion (33%) of this supply expected from imports that offer decarbonized and sustainably produced alternatives. These efforts will be complemented by the phasing out of grey hydrogen production in favor of low carbon methods—including retrofitting existing SMR/ATR plants for CCS or replacing them with new, zero-emission facilities.

Flexibility is a cornerstone feature expected from Europe's future energy systems due to imbalances between supply and demand resulting mainly from the intermittent nature of renewable sources feeding into electrolysis processes as well as variable heating demands associated with hydrogen usage for space or water heating. The EU envisions a mix of storage solutions, such as salt caverns currently in use today alongside potential expansions to depleted gas fields and other innovative methods like demand-side response mechanisms and e-fuels production that could contribute additional flexibility reserves.

However, the models used for scenario analysis suggest an underestimation of hydrogen storage needs; by 2050 a capacity equivalent to up to nine times current estimates may be required if conventional supply methods (i.e., SMR/ATR and imports) cannot meet these demands due to technical or economic constraints, particularly during extreme weather conditions where the demand spikes could outpace available flexibility resources significantly.

In summary, Europe's hydrogen strategy is set on a path toward cleaner production methodologies coupled with strategic international partnerships for green supply chains and substantial investments in storage solutions to support",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"In preparation for TYNDP 2024, scenario modeling has been conducted to assess various aspects of hydrogen production and storage within Europe up until 2050. The study predicts significant growth in electrolyzer capacity across the EU-27 region, reaching nearly 400 GW by mid-century under Distributed Energy scenarios or a similar figure for Global Ambition strategies (Figure 34). This expansion leverages both low marginal cost electricity from renewable sources and local availability of resources.

By the target year, all grey hydrogen production will have been phased out entirely in favor of cleaner options like SMR/ATR retrofitted with CCS or newly installed units without carbon capture (Figure 35). The role of low-carbon hydrogens is emphasized during early transition phases due to their importance for securing renewable supply.

The hydrogen system's evolving landscape also underscores the increasing need for flexibility, as both demand and production become more variable with advances in electrolysis technology (Figure 36). The model suggests that by 2050 an order of magnitude up to 180 TWh worth of working gas volume will be needed to balance supply-demand dynamics. Currently projected flexibility contributions, primarily from sources other than storage facilities such as SMR/ATR and imports (Figure 37), may not suffice due to potential limitations in these methods' capacity for delivering the required level of responsiveness.

The analysis suggests that hydrogen storage will ultimately need to play a critical role—possibly with up to nine times more volume than currently projected, considering factors such as geographic interconnectivity constraints and climate variability (Figure 36). This indicates an essential re-evaluation of the model's assumptions concerning flexibility provision in future hydrogen infrastructure planning.

For Austria specifically: The scenario models predict a refined understanding of how electrolyzer deployment, phased retirement or retrofitting of grey hydrogens production facilities like SMR/ATR with CCS technology (or their complete phase-out), and the rising demand for hydrogen flexibility will shape its energy landscape. With an anticipated increase in renewable electricity generation capacity contributing to electrolyzer power,"
4,4.4,4.4.3,Belgium,"By 2050, Europe's evolving energy landscape will necessitate substantial hydrogen storage capacity to balance supply and demand effectively within its decarbonized economy. Current modeling suggests an hourly flexibility requirement of up to 180 TWh for the hydrogen system; however, this figure may underestimate true needs due to limitations in non-storage sources such as SMR/ATR production or imports providing minimal flexibility contributions from technical and economic constraints.

If conventional methods offer only limited assistance with supply fluctuations—and considering potential disruptions caused by extreme climate events that could further strain the system's adaptability—the hydrogen storage capacity requirement may need to be recalibrated, potentially up to nine times higher than current scenario projections.

Europe must thus prioritize strategic investment in large-scale and diverse hydrogen storage solutions like salt caverns or depleted gas fields (where feasible) that can accommodate such significant flexibility demands while ensuring a reliable supply of clean, renewable hydrogens to support various applications from heating systems through industrial processes.

This foresight in infrastructure development is crucial as the continent transitions towards its ambitious 2050 targets and underpins broader efforts toward energy security amidst climate change mitigation commitments, reinforcing Europe's role within a global clean hydrogen market framework.",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"By 2050, Europe's energy landscape will significantly evolve to prioritize a clean hydrogen market as part of its ambitious climate goals and supply security strategy. The shift towards renewable sources for producing green (100% carbon-neutral) and blue (partially decarbonized through CCS technologies, reaching up to 95%) hydrogen is pivotal in this transformation. These sustainably produced forms of hydrogen will contribute a substantial share—387 TWh out of the total anticipated supply mix for Europe by that year—with imports playing an essential role as well (2083 TWh, or 981 TWh from renewable sources).

Central to this strategic shift is the advancement and scaling up of electrolyzer technologies. By mid-century, it's projected there will be nearly a gigawatt capacity for hydrogen production through these means—enough electricity provided by low marginal cost periods in wholesale markets or local renewable energy resources (RES) that are often geographically situated near consumption points to power electrolyzers. This development includes both hybrid systems, which integrate RES with the broader grid and dedicated ones directly linked to hydrogen infrastructure without necessitating additional electricity transmission capacity expansion—ultimately fostering an environment where renewable energy is leveraged at its fullest potential for clean fuel generation.

In stark contrast by 2050, traditional grey (high carbon) production methods using SMR/ATR units will have been entirely phased out under both scenarios examined: the Distributed Energy model and Global Ambition framework. For countries with existing CCS strategies in place—assumed to be retrofitted or replaced by 2030 as per scenario assumptions—the future hydrogen landscape is markedly different, featuring a dominant low carbon footprint across all sectors of production.

This transition will also necessitate considerable enhancements for system flexibility within the broader energy architecture due to variable renewable generation and fluctuating demand patterns associated with applications like heating using clean hydrogen fuels—demand that is inherently temperature-dependent, alongside seasonal variations in weather. To meet these demands while balancing supply over timeframes of up to 180 TWh working"
4,4.4,4.4.3,Bulgaria,"By 2050, to manage supply and demand imbalances within Europe's hydrogen system efficiently, it will be critical that up to an order of magnitude equivalent to roughly 180 TWh in working gas volume is available for storage flexibility—a requirement significantly underscored by the current modeling. However, this projection may not fully account for practical limitations such as connectivity issues between countries and extreme climate variations which could substantially increase these needs beyond projections.

In scenarios where conventional hydrogen production methods like SMR/ATR or imports contribute minimally to system flexibility—either due to economic constraints or technical infeasibilities—the reliance on dedicated storage facilities, such as salt caverns and potentially depleted gas fields (subject to overcoming existing challenges), becomes paramount. The present model suggests a lower than necessary capacity for hydrogen storage; hence revising it could reflect the true scale of flexibility required in future European energy systems heavily reliant on renewable-based hydrogen production, ensuring robustness and resilience against fluctuations inherent to weather patterns or surges in demand.",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"By 2050, to maintain a balanced and reliable supply of hydrogen within Europe's evolving energy landscape, significant flexibility in terms of working gas volume is anticipated—amounting up to an impressive 180 TWh capacity requirement. This figure represents the systemic need for adequate storage solutions that are capable not only to accommodate but also effectively manage fluctuations between supply and demand on a daily, seasonal basis as well as during unexpected climatic events or disruptions in conventional production flows like SMR/ATR operations.

The current scenario models may suggest an underestimation of this storage necessity due to the reliance primarily upon alternative sources for system flexibility such as other forms of energy generation and imports, which could be economically viable but technically limited over extended periods or in extreme circumstances. Should these alternate methods prove insufficiently flexible at scale, it's projected that hydrogen storage requirements may need to increase by a factor up to 9 times the current estimate for Distributed Energy (DE) and Global Ambition scenarios alike—a clear indication of how crucial strategic investments in large-scale salt cavern or depleted gas field infrastructure will be.

The geographical spread across European nations, like Bulgaria within this contextual framework, further complicates the storage landscape due to potential limitations on cross-border connections and varying regional climates which might necessitate even greater capacities for flexible hydrogen reserves—underscoring a critical juncture where Europe must adapt its infrastructure in anticipation of an energy future deeply intertwined with renewable sources, electricity flexibility demands, and the pivotal role that secure storage plays."
4,4.4,4.4.3,Czech Republic,"By 2050, Europe's transition towards a clean energy system heavily relies on hydrogen as an integral part of its supply mix and for achieving decarbonization goals across various sectors including heating, industry processes, transportation (both heavy-duty vehicles), aviation fuel production, maritime shipping propulsion, ammonia manufacturing via electrolysis from renewable sources, and as a means to enhance grid flexibility.

The European Union is set on significant investments in the hydrogen economy with an aim of reaching 20 million tonnes (Mt) by mid-century through various pathways: green/renewable electrolysis powered entirely by renewables, blue hydrogen produced from natural gas coupled with carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions below current levels in the absence of a broader CCS implementation strategy across Europe; grey hydrogen utilizing existing infrastructure for cost-effective decarbonization until 2050.

The EU's clean energy future envisions overcoming intermittent renewable generation and grid limitations with an ambitious rollout of electrolyzers, peaking at nearly 400 GW by the year 2050 for producing both green hydrogen (from direct electricity generated from wind or solar) and synthetic fuels.

This strategic vision includes a diverse mix to ensure supply adequacy: renewable energy-produced electrolysis in localized areas, hybrid systems combining onsite RES with grid connections for both production of green hydrogen (30%) as well as grey hydrogen from the wholesale market which together accounted for 78% and later a more balanced approach reaching up to two-thirds by mid-century.

The European Union's transition will phase out all SMR/ATR production without CCS technology, with existing facilities either retrofitted or replaced under planned scenarios aligning with national strategies where available - aimed for completion of such changes well before the 2030 mark in compliance-orientated countries.

Moreover, hydrogen's role extends beyond energy supply; it is instrumental as a storage and flexibility asset within Europe’s power grids to balance variable renewable generation peaks against demand fluct",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"By 2050, Europe's transition to a decarbonized hydrogen economy will necessitate significant advancements in electrolyser technology and infrastructure development across both Distributed Energy scenarios (DE) and Global Ambition scenario (GA). The projections indicate that by this year, the continent could see an installed capacity of around 400 gigawatts for electrolysers. This expansion is largely driven by Europe's decarbonized electricity market which will serve as a primary energy source to power these facilities—accounting for approximately 81% in both DE and GA scenarios until the mid-century mark, with substantial contributions from renewable sources integrated nearby or directly connected through dedicated RE assets.

As Europe moves away from grey hydrogen production due to its high carbon emissions by phasing out SMR/ATR without CCS systems entirely by 2050—replacing them either via retrofitting with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), decommissioning, or transitioning towards low-carbon electrolysis technologies in both scenarios. This strategic shift underscores the critical role of renewable hydrogen production as a cornerstone for ensuring supply adequacy within Europe's energy mix by 2050; with an estimated import provision of nearly half (981 TWh) to meet demand, emphasizing its significance in securing decarbonization progress.

The anticipated rise in hydrogen system flexibility reflects the increasingly dynamic nature of both supply and consumption patterns driven by temperature-dependent heating demands for renewable hydrogen as well as weather fluctuations impacting electrolytic production volumes, alongside peak electricity generation times necessitating dispatchability. While certain sources such as SMR/ATR or import terminals may offer some level of flexibility to balance the system's needs temporarily—current models suggest that storage will likely become a more vital component for achieving this equilibrium in hydrogen systems, given its demonstrated potential and scale-up feasibility observed today.

Considering these developments by 2050 Europe may require upwards of an order magnitude (180 TWh) worth of working gas volume to effectively balance the supply with demand fluctuations—a figure that underscores current model limitations which might"
4,4.4,4.4.3,Germany,"By 2050, to balance supply and demand within Europe's hydrogen system under various scenarios modeled in TYNDP 2024, there is an anticipated need for up to approximately 180 Terawatt-hours (TWh) of working gas volume. However, current modeling suggests that the majority of this required flexibility will be sourced from means other than hydrogen storage facilities due to economic and technical constraints which may preclude these facilities from meeting such extensive demands on their own.

Considerations indicate a potential underestimation in our models regarding the necessity for robust hydrogen storage capacity, with experts suggesting that actual requirements could be up to nine times higher than current projections take into account. This discrepancy may arise due to limitations inherent within cross-country connections and can also intensify if extreme climate conditions occur more frequently or severely in future years.

Figures 36 (Hydrogen Flexibility) and Figure 37 illustrate the hourly flexibility requirements for hydrogen across different scenarios, with a specific focus on Germany's role within this context by showing how much additional capacity might be needed to ensure system stability as we move closer towards achieving net-zero targets.

In summary, while current strategies incorporate some level of storage and other flexible resources into the European hydrogen landscape, it is clear that a significant increase in dedicated infrastructure for large-scale energy storage will likely become imperative if Europe intends to maintain supply reliability amidst growing fluctuations driven by renewable integration.",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"By 2050, Europe's energy landscape is transforming significantly due to a strong focus on decarbonization and renewable hydrogen production. The scenario modeling for this TYNDP (Transport & Hydrogen Energy Deployment Plan) in 2024 highlights the pivotal role of electrolyzers, which are expected to achieve near-capacity levels at around 400 GW by mid-century under Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios. These advancements will largely rely on surplus renewable energy (RES) from wholesale markets for powering the hydrogen electrolysis process, with a significant portion of production stemming directly from RES sources within proximity to consumption areas—either through hybrid systems that combine nearby RES and grid connectivity or dedicated facilities designed solely around local renewable resources.

The transition away from grey (non-renewable) hydrogen is clear, with all SMR/ATR plants expected either decommissioned by 2050 without carbon capture storage (CCS), retrofitted for CCS operation where strategies are in place or replaced entirely—a reality that will be fully realized across the EU. By contrasting scenarios, a consistent trajectory emerges: all such facilities must evolve to align with stringent decarbonization goals by 2050.

In parallel, hydrogen's role as an energy vector is becoming increasingly complex and intertwined with grid flexibility needs due to its variable nature of supply driven by weather patterns for RES-based electrolysis or seasonal demand changes from heating applications in buildings. The necessity for a robust storage solution becomes apparent, where salt caverns are already proven but may need supplementary technologies such as depleted gas fields with ongoing technical challenges to be resolved fully by the midpoint of this century.

The modeling underscores an underestimation in current flexibility requirements—upwards of 180 TWh working volume needed for hydrogen supply and demand equilibrium, suggesting a potential overlooked reliance solely on storage solutions such as salt caverns or depleted gas fields may be insufficient. As the traditional sources like SMR/ATR are phased out in favor of renewable-based electroly"
4,4.4,4.4.3,Denmark,"By 2050, to effectively balance supply and demand within Europe's hydrogen system, a significant volume of up to an order magnitude equivalent to approximately 180 TWh in working gas capacity is anticipated for storage solutions like salt caverns or depleted natural gas fields. The current scenario modeling suggests that while SMR/ATR production and imports contribute some flexibility, they might not suffice given economic constraints and technical limitations of these sources to provide the necessary extent of adaptability required by an increasingly imbalanced hydrogen market due to seasonal demands for heating or weather-dependent renewable energy supplies.

Consequently, there is a potential underestimation in modeling regarding storage capacity requirements; should conventional production and import capacities prove insufficient as flexible resources—owing not only to their limited nature but also possible interconnection limitations between countries—the actual need for hydrogen storage might be up to nine times higher than currently projected. Moreover, extreme climate variations could exacerbate this demand on the flexibility of supply and further elevate these requirements beyond current projections in both Distributed Energy scenarios as well as Global Ambition objectives by 2050.

In summary, it's essential to recognize that while hydrogen has a substantial role within Europe’s energy transition towards decarbonization—with electrolysers being key components utilizing renewable sources and imported low carbon-produced hydrogen complementing the domestic supply mix—there is an acute need for enhancing storage solutions. This will ensure not only that flexibility demands are met but also to maintain system reliability amidst fluctuating market conditions, varying energy generation profiles from renewables, and evolving infrastructure capabilities across European nations like Denmark in particular.",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"The current and future landscape of Europe's energy system is increasingly influenced by hydrogen, which plays a pivotal role in ensuring supply adequacy as renewable sources expand their share. By 2050, nearly half (49%) of the EU’s total electricity demand could be met with green and low-carbon solutions including large offshore wind farms generating around 1376 TWh annually alongside a surge in electrolyzer capacity nearing approximately 400 GW. Hydrogen, produced from renewables within the EU (2083 TWh) with imported quantities reaching up to 981 TWh of decarbonized hydrogen accounting for an import share of about 33%, is vital in maintaining a balanced supply-demand dynamic across Europe.

Electrolysis, the process converting electricity into green and low-carbon hydrogen without emissions or byproducts when powered with renewables (green electrolysers), will become central to this energy transition. In scenarios for 2050 set out in Distributed Energy and Global Ambition models, a significant increase of up to nearly fourfold capacity is projected compared to today's levels—indicative that the majority comes from wholesale electricity markets due to their low marginal costs during periods with high renewable output.

Hydrogen production will undergo substantial changes; grey hydrogen, which relies on fossil fuels and emits CO2 without carbon capture technology (CCS), is expected to be phased out completely by 2050 in both scenarios modelled—Distributed Energy with a complete halt of SMR/ATR operations not equipped or retrofitted for CCS, alongside all new plants adopting such technologies.

The system role hydrogen will assume goes hand-in-hand with an increased need for flexibility due to imbalances between supply and demand driven by variable renewable energy sources like wind power that could lead up to 180 TWh of working gas volume requirement in storage facilities across Europe's network. These figures highlight a potential underestimation within the current model, as it relies on alternative flexibility providers such as SMR/ATR and imports rather than dedicated hydrogen storage solutions like salt caverns"
4,4.4,4.4.3,Estonia,"By 2050, both scenarios Distributed Energy and Global Ambition underscore a significant need for hydrogen storage to achieve system balance due to inherent imbalances in supply-demand dynamics influenced by weather variations affecting renewable energy production (electrolysis) as well as temperature dependence impacting heating demand. Current models may not fully capture the extent of required flexibility, indicating that actual future hydrogen storage requirements could be up to nine times higher than currently anticipated for both economic and technical reasons. This suggests a critical reassessment is necessary: if conventional production methods such as SMR/ATR or imports offer limited contribution towards systemic balance through their inflexibility (very low), the role of strategically developed hydrogen storage facilities becomes even more crucial to ensure adequate supply and demand synchronization.

In detail, this implies that future planning must incorporate robust models for hydrogen flexibility which acknowledge: 1) The primary potential contributions from other sources may not suffice; thus elevating the importance of dedicated energy storage solutions like salt caverns or possibly depleted gas fields as viable long-term options. These technologies, while currently challenging in some aspects (technical hurdles), are key to achieving a sustainable and flexible hydrogen system by 2050;
   
   Furthermore, the potential increase due to unpredictable climate conditions or infrastructural limitations between countries should be accounted for. This could lead policymakers towards proactive strategies that not only focus on storage capacity but also ensure a resilient and adaptive hydrogen network capable of handling extreme scenarios efficiently;
   
   In summary, while Distributed Energy's model provides valuable insights into the potential future role of renewable energy-based electrolysers in Europe’s decarbonization efforts by 2050 (with a projected capacity nearing 400 GW), it also highlights an underestimation when not considering hydrogen storage's critical importance. A recalibrated approach emphasizing large scale, geographically distributed and technologically advanced energy storages is recommended to support the envisioned transition towards a sustainable European low-carbon economy driven by renewable resources for both electricity generation and clean fuel production via electrolysis;
   
   In",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"In future projections, by 2050, a critical volume of up to an order magnitude—specifically around 180 TWh equivalent in working gas capacity for hydrogen storage—is essential to balance supply and demand within Europe's evolving hydrogen system. However, the current scenario model may not fully capture this requirement due to certain limitations:

- **Storage Capacity Limitations**: The scenarios presume that traditional production methods (SMR/ATR) along with imports will offer minimal flexibility contributions for managing imbalances in supply and demand of hydrogen. This oversight might lead the modeling outcomes underestimating actual storage needs, as these sources are not expected to provide sufficient elasticity on their own.
  
- **Technical Challenges**: There remain technical challenges for large scale integration into existing infrastructure; depleted gas fields present potential future solutions but aren't yet fully realized or understood in terms of feasibility and scalability, thus currently not contributing significantly to the model’s flexibility metrics.
  
- **Geographic Connectivity Constraints**: Variations across countries regarding hydrogen connections can exacerbate storage requirements; some regions might be less able due to infrastructural or geographical constraints affecting how efficiently they contribute towards collective system balance, further inflating the required flexibility.
  
- **Climatic Extremities Impact**: In years where weather patterns are particularly harsh—such as extended periods of low wind for renewable energy generation in electrolysis or unexpected demand spikes due to colder temperatures increasing heating needs via hydrogen applications — the discrepancy between supply and demand might be greater than forecasted, thus necessitating a higher reliance on storage capacity.
  
The modeling should incorporate these considerations for more accurate estimations of future flexibility requirements within Europe's transition to a decarbonized hydrogen marketplace by 2050 under both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios, ensuring robustness against potential supply-demand mismatches.

Figures (36 & 37) illustrate the projected need for flexibility in terms of working gas volumes as well as peak hourly requirements across Europe's hydrogen system by midpoint to late century; these visual"
4,4.4,4.4.3,Spain,"By 2050, Europe's transition to a clean energy future is heavily reliant on hydrogen as both an essential fuel source and pivotal for enhancing system flexibility within its power infrastructure. The European Union (EU) anticipates that renewable-derived green hydrogen will become the cornerstone of this new era, with projections showing a substantial increase in electrolyser capacity to nearly 400 GW by mid-century—accounting for approximately three-quarters of its electricity supply.

The EU's strategy involves leveraging surplus renewable energy from sources such as wind and solar power via direct connection (Dedicated RES) or hybrid integration with the wholesale market, facilitating large scale production without necessitating grid expansion—this is especially crucial in locales where these resources are abundant.

A significant shift away from traditional hydrogen-producing methods such as SMR/ATR and grey electrolysis will be implemented; by 2050, they'll have been either retrofitted with carbon capture technology (CSS), phased out altogether or replaced entirely in favor of green production pathways.

The role hydrogen plays extends beyond fueling vehicles to encompass the storage and delivery system flexibility needed for balancing electricity supply against demand patterns that fluctuate due to renewable energy intermittency, as well as temperature-dependent heating demands. While current systems may use SMR/ATR or imports occasionally for this purpose, it is evident these methods alone will not suffice at the scale required in 2050—the system's flexibility needs are projected to be upwards of 180 TWh working gas volume.

To address such extensive requirements adequately and ensure a robust transition towards hydrogen-centric energy systems, substantial investments must flow into developing storage capabilities like salt caverns or possibly exploring the viability of depleted natural gas fields for future use as high capacity reservoirs to accommodate fluctuating supply needs.

Europe's commitment is clear: by 2050, it aims not only to phase out grey hydrogen production but also ensure that its energy mix will be dominated by low-carbon options—strategically positioning the",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"In anticipation of a future where renewable energy is paramount, by 2050 hydrogen's role in Europe will be crucial for maintaining supply adequacy and decarbonizing our energy systems. With an expected electrolyser capacity near 400 GW, the majority sourcing from low-cost wholesale electricity markets complemented by renewable resources (RES) close to consumption hubs, Europe's hydrogen strategy will pivot towards a clean and integrated supply chain that diminishes reliance on traditional fossil fuels.

By this timeframe, the production of grey hydrogen is projected for complete cessation in favor of low-carbon alternatives like electrolytic synthesis powered by renewable electricity or SMR/ATR equipped with carbon capture and storage (CCS). The decline of conventional methods will be matched only marginally, as a residual amount—5 TWh from retrofitted CCS plants in countries possessing such infrastructures—remains operational.

As hydrogen's flexibility becomes indispensable for balancing the intermittent nature of renewables and demand patterns influenced by temperature changes or peak load scenarios, storage emerges as a critical component within Europe’s energy framework. With an anticipated need to manage up to 180 TWh in working gas volume balance fluctuations annually come challenges tied not just technically but also geographically and economically for hydrogen storages like salt caverns or depleted gas fields, which must be strategized within the broader context of Europe's intricate energy network.

Refining our perspective on this emergent landscape where renewables drive electrolysis-based production alongside imports from diverse regions underpins a nuanced understanding: flexibility and storage are not simply options but imperatives that will define how effectively we navigate the transition to an all-encompassing low carbon hydrogen economy in Europe.

Figures illustrating these dynamics, such as Fig 36 Hydrogen Flexibility (showcasing hourly needs) or Figure 37 highlighting Spain's contribution within a global scenario of up to MW capacity by the year 2050, serve not only an informational purpose but also guide policymakers and stakehold"
4,4.4,4.4.3,Finland,"Finland's role within the European Union's transition to a clean hydrogen economy is pivotal, particularly as we project towards achieving ambitious carbon neutrality by 2050. By this milestone year, it’s anticipated that Finland will have significantly phased out its dependence on grey (high-carbon) hydrogen production methods such as SMR/ATR without CCS technology and instead pivot fully to renewable sources for both domestic consumption and exportation of clean hydrogens.

The nation's strategic approach involves leveraging local resources, particularly from Renewables Closed to Consumption (RES), which can either be directly supplied or utilize a hybrid model with nearby RES as well as the wholesale electricity market for electrolyser operations—a technique that ensures minimal grid expansion. In this context, Finland is expected not only to supply 981 TWh of hydrogen domestically by harnessing renewable energy but also contribute approximately one-third (33%) towards a diversified EU clean hydrogen market through imports from its strategic position and resourceful infrastructure for production.

The country's commitment extends to an aggressive development strategy in electrolyser capacity, with the aim of reaching nearly 400 GW by mid-century—this entails not only substantial investments but also a careful balance between leveraging windy terrains and integrating into both national and transnational energy networks.

For hydrogen production that falls short on cleanliness (noted as 'grey' in the scenario), Finland will follow EU mandates, phasing out all such sources by 2050 through retrofitting with carbon capture or complete decommissioning—with a nod towards sustainability and climate goals.

In line with systemic requirements for flexibility within hydrogen infrastructure to balance supply fluctuations due in part to weather-dependent renewable inputs, Finland recognizes the role of storage capacity expansion as critical, addressing potential limitations posed by current technologies which may not suffice at scale or speed.

Given these insights into Finnish strategy and its integration within EU's overarching goals for clean hydrogen production—coupled with a realistic appraisal of the flexibility requirements that storage facilities will fulfill",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"In Finnish, the text could be revised and presented as follows:

4,4.4,4.4.3,France,"By 2050, Europe's transition to a clean energy system will significantly rely on hydrogen as both an end-use fuel and for grid flexibility purposes. The European Union is expected to see substantial growth in electrolyzer capacity reaching nearly 400 GW by mid-century under Distributed Energy (DE) scenarios or Global Ambition models, with the majority of this supply powered either directly from renewable electricity sources like wind and solar—which can feed into wholesale markets during low demand periods for cost efficiency—or through dedicated resources located near consumption areas to avoid grid expansion.

In both DE and GA scenarios by 2050, the use of grey hydrogen is phased out entirely in favor of green or blue (with carbon capture) sources as part of Europe's commitment to decarbonization goals. Smaller scale steam methane reforming units without CCS will be decommissioned unless they are retrofitted with CCUS technology, a transformation expected by 2030 where feasible according to national strategies outlined in the EU climate agenda.

The hydrogen system's flexibility requirements showcase an increase from current practices due to more variable renewable energy sources and demand patterns driven by heating needs that fluctuate with temperature changes throughout seasons, as well as potentially greater variability introduced through electrolytic production based on weather conditions affecting solar or wind generation.

Despite these challenges in forecast models indicating a need for flexibility up to 180 TWh of working gas volume by mid-century—with most coming from sources other than storage facilities like SMR/ATR, e-fuels production, import terminals and demand side response mechanisms due primarily to economic or technical limitations on hydrogen as an active grid resource.

It's critical for the EU's long term strategy that any underestimation of these flexibility requirements leads policymakers towards a greater emphasis on expanding dedicated storage solutions, such as salt caverns and potentially depleted gas fields—the latter still facing technical challenges but being an area ripe for future research. Such strategic investments in hydrogen infrastructure will be essential to maintain supply-demand balance while the EU's energy system transitions towards a fully renewable, sustainable grid that",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"In preparation for TYNDP 2024, scenario modelling reveals that by 2050 Europe's hydrogen system will require significant flexibility to balance supply and demand effectively—demanding up to an order of magnitude equivalent to 180 terawatt-hours (TWh) in working gas volume. However, the current model appears to underestimate this requirement as it relies heavily on alternative sources for flexibility beyond storage facilities due to economic or technical constraints that may not suffice at such large scales.

Specifically focusing on France within these scenarios: The need for hydrogen system flexibility in 2050 is substantial, with the hourly requirement potentially reaching high megawatt (MW) values as illustrated below. Given this context and considering limitations like cross-country connections or more extreme climatic conditions that could further elevate storage needs by a factor of up to nine times, it becomes evident that France must prioritize expanding its hydrogen storage capacity significantly beyond initial estimates provided in the scenarios' flexibility models (see Figure 37 for hourly requirements).

To ensure supply security and meet environmental targets within Europe’s ambitious clean energy transition plans, enhancing national strategies to incorporate sufficient large-scale hydrogen infrastructure—particularly storage solutions such as salt caverns or depleted gas fields (with ongoing technical challenges) —will be critical. France's approach in the TYNDP 2024 scenarios should reflect these realities, acknowledging that while SMR/ATR and imports may offer limited flexibility contributions to date, a comprehensive strategy is necessary for future system reliability and decarbonization efforts as part of Europe’s collective energy security framework."
4,4.4,4.4.3,Greece,"The future of Europe's energy landscape by 2050 will be significantly shaped by hydrogen, with a substantial portion (33%) originating from renewable sources and being imported to ensure supply adequacy across the Union. The electrolyser capacity is projected to reach almost 400 GW in both Distributed Energy scenarios—where local resources are primarily utilized alongside wholesale electricity markets for hydrogen production, known as hybrid RES (Renewable Resources) and Direct Dedicated RES setups respectively.

In these futuristic models, the prevalence of grey hydrogen is completely phased out by 2050 due to its carbon emissions. The transition involves either decommissioning or retrofitting existing small-scale power plants (SMR/ATR) with Carbon Capture and Storage technology, alongside a strategic reduction in their number within the Distributed Energy scenario but retaining some for Global Ambition until 2050 due to continued low carbon hydrogen demand.

Hydrogen's flexibility role will be increasingly important as it supports both heating demands with temperature-dependent usage patterns and contributes to grid balancing by storing excess renewable energy during periods of surplus, releasing this stored power when required—particularly at peak times or in cases where supply does not align perfectly with demand.

A significant challenge identified is the potential underestimation of hydrogen storage needs for system flexibility; models suggest a requirement up to 180 TWh by 2050, but current and future technological solutions may fall short without considering additional factors like weather extremities or infrastructure limitations that could raise this need even further. The emphasis on diverse sources of hydrogen production—from electrolysis facilitated largely through renewable energy integration to strategic imports for balancing supply-demand discrepancies across Europe, especially in countries with limited local resources like Greece—highlight the complexity and multifaceted approach required to meet future demands while achieving emissions targets.

The key takeaway is that by 2050 hydrogen will not only be a pivotal element for decarbonization efforts within Europe, but also an intricate part of its energy flexibility architecture—demanding careful planning and invest",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"In evaluating European Union's future energy landscape up to 2050, we scrutinize two pivotal scenarios that delineate pathways toward a hydrogen-centric economy: Distributed Energy and Global Ambition (GA). Both anticipate significant growth in electrolyser capacity due to the decarbonization of electricity generation. By this juncture, an impressive 398 GW worth of electrolysers is projected across EU27 countries—with a substantial portion leveraging renewable energy sources either directly or via hybrid systems with wholesale markets (representing approximately 81% in both scenarios).

Central to these projections are the strategic roles that hydrogen storage and flexibility play within an increasingly imbalanced supply-demand dynamic. The current state of affairs sees baseload demand intertwined with dispatchable supplies, a pattern which is anticipated to transform as renewable sources become more prevalent through electrolysis. This shift ushers in the necessity for robust flexibility solutions—a challenge where hydrogen storage emerges not only as critical but also potentially insufficient when relying solely on existing models and infrastructure capacities, such as salt caverns or depleted gas fields (with technical hurdles yet to be surmounted).

By 2050, the systemic flexibility requirement for hydrogen balances could reach upwards of 180 TWh in working storage volume. However, with conventional production and imports offering minimal contribution towards this goal due to economic or infrastructural constraints—and considering potential extreme climatic conditions that may further strain these systems—the need for enhanced flexibility capacity might surge by a factor up to nine times the initial estimates within both scenarios (Distributed Energy & GA).

To ensure energy security and sustainability, it is crucial not only to expand hydrogen production capacities but also strategically develop storage facilities capable of providing substantial systemic support. This approach will facilitate balancing renewable intermittency with demand patterns—a cornerstone for a resilient, decarbonized European energy future by 2050 that harmonizes supply and consumption dynamics across the continent's diverse grid landscapes."
4,4.4,4.4.3,Croatia,"In line with our analysis of future energy trends, by 2050 hydrogen will play a pivotal role in Europe's decarbonized grid mix, potentially supplying up to approximately 981 TWh through imports from renewable sources. This represents about one-third (33%) of the EU’s projected total electricity demand by that year and underscores hydrogen as a crucial element in ensuring supply consistency amidst varying energy demands.

The expansion trajectory for electrolysers is significant, with capacities anticipated to near 400 GW within this timeframe under both the Distributed Energy scenario (DE) and Global Ambition scenarios (GA). The integration of these systems into Europe's infrastructure will predominantly utilize wholesale electricity markets due to their capacity during periods with low marginal costs. In addition, strategic placement near renewable energy sources or dedicated RES installations can optimize local hydrogen production without necessitating grid expansion—this dual approach of hybrid and standalone systems will be critical for the efficient generation of green H2 across diverse geographical areas within Europe's landscape (Figure 35).

As part of our transition plan, it is imperative that all grey-emitting hydrogen production from SMR/ATR facilities without carbon capture technology ceases by mid-century. However, a subset will be retrofitted with CCS in countries where such strategies are already articulated and implemented—this process should ideally reach completion across Europe's existing capacity by 2030 (Figure 34).

The shift toward low carbon hydrogen is expected to dominate the initial stages of this transition, thereby securing renewable energy availability while progressively phasing out more conventional methods. By contrast, in a GA scenario with increasing electrolyser capacity and rising demand for green H2 from heating applications—both affected by weather variability (e-fuel production)—the need for substantial storage solutions becomes evident to accommodate the system's growing flexibility requirements.

By 2050, Europe will require hydrogen systems capable of balancing upwards of 180 TWh in working gas volume annually due to fluctuating supply and demand patterns (Figure 36",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"By 2050, Europe's transition to a clean energy future hinges on hydrogen as both an essential supply component and pivotal flexibility resource in our power systems. The EU is set to significantly scale up its electrolyser capacity nearly reaching 400 GW by the end of this decade—primarily driven by renewable sources, with a substantial share (33%) coming from clean hydrogen imports essential for maintaining supply-demand equilibrium amidst varying energy generation scenarios.

Within these developments lies an increased reliance on electrolysis powered predominantly through wholesale electricity markets and renewable sources, including hybrid systems that integrate local RES (Renewable Energy Sources) directly with hydrogen production or dedicated installations connected to existing grids. The strategic shift towards a zero-emission portfolio entails the phasing out of grey hydrogen by 2050 in favor of low carbon alternatives, aligning closely with decarbonization efforts and renewable energy integration across EU nations—even as certain countries adapt their CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) strategies.

However, despite these advancements towards clean production methods like SMR/ATR retrofitting or replacing them entirely for hydrogen generation by 2050 in Distributed Energy scenarios, it's clear that flexibility—especially from storage solutions such as salt caverns and potentially depleted gas fields with ongoing technical challenges addressed—will remain crucial. The systemic role of hydrogen will evolve to accommodate not only baseload demand but also the intermittent nature inherent in renewable sources, necessitating a robust storage mechanism capable of managing upwards of 180 TWh by mid-century for effective balancing acts against supply fluctuations.

In this transition towards an electrified and hydrogen economy underpinned by diverse energy resources like electrolysis from renewables, the EU's approach to flexibility will likely necessitate a reevaluation of storage capacities—potentially upwards of nine times more than currently modeled scenarios suggest. Such foresight is essential as it acknowledges limitations in other sources providing necessary system-wide adaptability and emphasizes hydrogen’s critical role within the broader context of"
4,4.4,4.4.3,Hungary,"In line with TYNDP 2024's scenario modeling, by 2050, Europe will necessitate up to an order of magnitude equivalent flexibility in hydrogen storage—amounting to approximately 180 terawatt-hours (TWh) working gas volume. This requirement stems from the need to balance supply and demand within a future energy system increasingly characterized by imbalances due, for example, to temperature fluctuations affecting heating demands or weather variability impacting renewable hydrogen production through electrolysis.

Current models indicate that most of this needed flexibility will not be sourced from storage facilities alone—both on technical and economic grounds suggesting limitations in their capacity for large-scale provision. Therefore, the actual necessity might exceed model estimations by as much as ninefold due to potential constraints like cross-border infrastructure bottlenecks or more severe climate conditions that could further strain hydrogen supply consistency.

This underlines a critical consideration: while SMR/ATR and other sources may offer some degree of flexibility, they are not expected to suffice in isolation for meeting the full spectrum of demand fluctuations within Europe's evolving energy landscape by 2050. Thus, substantial investment into hydrogen storage solutions—ranging from salt caverns with proven potential and future possibilities like depleted gas fields that are still under technological research—is essential to ensure a resilient supply chain for this clean fuel in Europe's energy transition journey toward 2050.

Hungary, as an individual country within the European context highlighted here, would need to align its national strategies and investments with these broader regional dynamics while leveraging opportunities that such a hydrogen-centric future could provide for increased sustainability in energy systems across Europe by 2050.",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"In anticipation of a transformative energy future, by 2050 within EU countries such as Hungary, there's an expectation for hydrogen to play a pivotal role in both production and consumption patterns. The scenario modeling conducted up until the TYNDP (Technology, Research & Innovation Deployment Plan) of 2024 predicts significant advancements across various sectors:

1. **Electrolysis Capacity** - By leveraging renewable energy sources and technological innovations like hybrid RES-centric electrolyzers, there's a projected rise to nearly 400 GW in hydrogen production capacity for the EU27 region by mid-century.

2. **Carbon-Neutral Hydrogen** - Phasing out grey hydrogen production entirely by 2050 is a central objective with both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios focusing on substantial low carbon or renewable sources to meet this target, underlining the commitment towards achieving decarbonization in energy supply.
   
   _Source_: Hypothetical Data Analysis - Hungarian Strategy for Low Carbon Hydrogen Transitions (Hungary Energy Commission).

3. **Flexibility and Storage** – Recognizing that future hydrogen systems will exhibit greater fluctuations in supply-demand dynamics, there's a pressing need to enhance flexibility mechanisms including storage solutions like salt caverns or depleted gas fields (with ongoing technical challenges). By 2050, the system may require upwards of an order magnitude increase for working hydrogen gas volume — potentially as much as nine times more than current capacities.

4,4.4,4.4.3,Italy,"By 2050, Europe's transition to clean energy is deeply intertwined with hydrogen as a pivotal element in its decarbonized supply mix and for ensuring adequate balance between demand and production within an increasingly imbalanced system. The projected scale of electrolyser capacity across the EU27, reaching near 400 GW by mid-century under Distributed Energy (DE) scenarios or Global Ambition frameworks, underscores hydrogen's crucial role in leveraging renewable energy sources and providing supply diversity to meet peak demands.

Grey hydrogen production faces a phaseout trajectory leading up to 2050 with all Small Modular Reactors (SMR) or Advanced Turbine Reactor plants without carbon capture technology either retired, retrofitted for CCS by countries like Sweden and the UK before this deadline, converted into low-carbon operations if feasible elsewhere in Europe, replaced entirely under DE scenarios. However, a small portion of SMR with CSS is expected to remain operational as late as 2050 within Global Ambition contexts for transitional energy needs or specific industrial applications.

The hydrogen economy's future hinges on its flexibility – encompassed by the system’s need, upwards of an estimated 180 TWh in working gas volume to harmonize supply with demand fluctuations and temperature-sensitive heating requirements across Europe. This challenge extends beyond current storage capabilities; it necessitates a significant expansion as conventional production sources like SMR/ATR may offer limited flexibility, underscoring the potential underestimation of hydrogen storage capacities in model projections for 2050 scenarios within both DE and Global Ambition frameworks.

The intricate dance between renewable energy integration via electrolysis – powered by wholesale market surpluses or localized, dedicated RES installations (hybrid vs direct connections) - further emphasizes the strategic importance of hydrogen not just as an alternative fuel source but also a facilitator for grid flexibility. This includes leveraging existing infrastructure where possible and anticipating technological advancements in storage methods such as salt caverns or potentially depleted gas fields, acknowledging both current demonstrations and ongoing technical challenges that",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"By 2050, to ensure a balanced and flexible European Hydrogen System amidst variable renewable energy generation patterns and fluctuating demand (particularly for heating), substantial hydrogen storage capacity is essential. The projected need ranges up to an impressive working gas volume of around 180 TWh—a critical figure that highlights the system's complexity in managing supply-demand equilibrium over time frames extending beyond mere hours, potentially spanning several days or weeks due to weather variations and peak demand periods.

The current scenario modelling suggests flexibility predominantly comes from sources other than storage facilities like SMR/ATR production capacities, e-fuel generation, import terminals, as well as through various forms of demand side response measures—all pivotal for a resilient and adaptable hydrogen network. However, it's clear that these alternative flexibility mechanisms may not be sufficient to fully satisfy the systemic requirements due to economic constraints or technical limitations inherent in other resources like conventional production methods (SMR/ATR) which provide limited capacity-based elasticity for demand balancing purposes.

Thus, there's a significant gap between current flexibility projections and actual storage needs—a discrepancy that could be as much as nine times larger than initially calculated across Distributed Energy scenarios or Global Ambition outcomes (GA 2050). This underlines the importance of developing substantial hydrogen storage solutions, such as expanding existing salt caverns for short-term flexibility and investigating long-term possibilities like using depleted gas fields—even though there remain technical challenges to address.

To mitigate risks associated with connectivity constraints between countries or unexpected extremities in weather conditions impacting hydrogen supply, a more robust storage solution strategy is paramount for the European Hydrogen System's sustainability and reliability goals set out by 2050 targets within TYNDP. The increased flexibility requirement underscores an urgent need to reassess current models in light of these potential shortcomings, ensuring that Europe is equipped with the necessary infrastructure for a successful transition towards clean hydrogen energy dominance and grid stability through adequate storage capacity development."
4,4.4,4.4.3,Lithuania,"In Lithuania, by 2050, there is a significant demand for hydrogen flexibility to balance supply and demand within their energy system. The scenario modeling indicates that up to an order of magnitude equivalent to approximately 180 TWh in working gas volume will be necessary as part of the nation's transition towards cleaner energy sources.

Currently, Lithuania relies on alternative flexibility providers aside from hydrogen storage facilities for this purpose due to economic and technical constraints that may prevent them from meeting such extensive requirements alone. This suggests a potential underestimation in modeling scenarios regarding actual need; if conventional production methods (SMR/ATR) and imports are not expected to supply significant levels of flexibility, the essential requirement could be as much as nine times greater than currently projected for Lithuania's hydrogen storage capacity.

The country must also consider potential limitations in interconnection with neighboring nations alongside more extreme weather events that might further strain this need for flexible energy supplies and storage solutions to ensure a reliable, resilient power infrastructure moving forward into the 2050 horizon.",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"By 2050, as part of Europe's ambitious TYNDP strategy to achieve a decarbonized energy system and meet its climate goals, hydrogen plays an increasingly vital role in both supply and demand aspects across the EU-27. The integration of renewable energies is crucial for producing clean hydrogen via electrolyzers with capacities projected near 400 GW by mid-century under scenarios known as Distributed Energy (DE) and Global Ambition (GA).

The current energy landscape sees a significant portion, nearly one third of the EU's electricity demand being met through hydrogen imports from regions rich in renewable resources. This highlights not only Europe’s reliance on external sources for its clean energy transition but also underscores the importance of creating an interconnected and diversified global market to ensure a stable supply that is both sustainable and decarbonized, with expectations set at 981 TWh from imports by 2050.

Electrolyzers are central in this transformation as they enable the production of hydrogen without carbon emissions; their projections show a vast increase to cater for both local and imported low-carbon needs, with solar power being harnessed significantly due to its prevalence across Europe's energy mix.

As part of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) impact further into the future – particularly targeting net zero emissions by 2050 for all sectors excluding aviation and shipping, including a phased-out production from grey hydrogen sources - both DE and GA scenarios emphasize an aggressive phase-down of traditional steam methane reformers (SMR) or autothermal reformers (ATR). Under these projections, by 2050 SMR/ATR facilities without carbon capture storage are either decommissioned or retrofitted with CCS technology.

In terms of system flexibility – a critical component for balancing the inherently variable nature of renewable energy sources like wind and solar against demand patterns that may fluctuate throughout the day, week, season, etc., - there is an anticipated need to increase hydrogen storage capacity significantly by 2050. The scenarios suggest up to 180 TWh working gas"
4,4.4,4.4.3,Luxembourg,"By 2050, Europe's transition to a clean energy future will heavily rely on hydrogen as both an end-use fuel and for enhancing system flexibility within its electricity grid. The European Union (EU) is set to meet the majority of its projected decarbonised hydrogen demand through domestic production sourced from renewable energies, with imports playing a substantial role in supplementing supply shortages or during periods when local generation capacity does not match consumption needs.

The EU's ambition for 2050 involves an impressive electrolyser installation base nearing 400 GW—a clear indicator of the region’s commitment to leveraging renewable electricity and hydrogen production technologies, such as those based on solar (PV) or wind power. These installations will not only supply clean energy but also actively contribute by providing system flexibility necessary for balancing intermittent renewables with demand patterns throughout the day and year.

In scenarios where greenhouse gas emissions are minimized, electrolysers become primary sources of hydrogen production—linked to a robust decarbonised electricity market that enables efficient use during low-cost energy periods while also benefiting from local availability in proximate regions with renewable resources (RES).

The current strategy includes the phasing out of grey hydrogen by 2050, either through decommissioning older plants or retrofitting existing Small Modular Reactors/Advanced Turbine-based Combined Cycle units to incorporate carbon capture and storage technologies. In parallel with this evolution, a shift is anticipated away from such SMRs towards other sources of green hydrogen production as well as leveraging imports that align with the EU's strict environmental standards—ensuring not just adequacy but also sustainability in supply chains across Europe and beyond its borders.

The role hydrogen plays extends into enhancing flexibility, which is vital due to fluctuating renewable outputs; it will function as a buffer for electricity grid stability by storing excess energy during peak production times or releasing power when demand surges—demonstrated through the significant working gas volume requirements of up to 180 TWh needed in future projections.

In conclusion, Europe's hydrogen strategy",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"In both scenarios, by 2050 all Small-Scale Modular Reactors (SMRs) and Atmospheric Pressure Turbines without carbon capture will either be decommissioned or retrofitted with Carbon Capture Storage (CCS). Countries that have a CCS strategy in place are expected to complete this transition by 2030. During the early stages of decarbonization, low-carbon hydrogen production becomes crucial for maintaining renewable supply consistency and facilitating system flexibility within Europe's energy landscape until more advanced technologies become widespread or phased out entirely in Distributed Energy scenarios by 2050.

The evolving role of the integrated European Hydrogen System underscores a significant shift from baseload hydrogen demand, largely met through SMR/ATR and imports towards an imbalanced system characterized by variable renewable energy-driven electrolysis production paired with fluctuating seasonal heating demands. This transition necessitates extensive storage solutions to address the heightened need for flexibility—estimated at up to 180 TWh of working gas volume in GA2050 scenarios, potentially highlighting an understated requirement when compared against existing models that may not fully account for limitations arising from less adaptable production methods and cross-border infrastructure constraints.

The forecasted expansion towards renewable hydrogen underscores the need to reassess storage capacities within Europe's energy framework, recognizing salt caverns as current providers of flexibility while exploring potential future developments such as repurposing depleted gas fields for this purpose. The TYNDP 2024 scenario model acknowledges the multifaceted sources and mechanisms contributing to system-wide balance, including but not limited to SMR/ATR operation timescales (peak or off-grid), imports from diverse geographies with varying renewable profiles, demand response strategies across sectors like transportation where hydrogen's role may expand significantly, and the integration of energy storage solutions—all components intricately woven into Europe’s vision for a sustainable, flexible, low carbon future in its quest to meet climate objectives by 2050.

4,4.4,4.4.3,Latvia,"By 2050, Europe's transition to a clean energy system will significantly rely on hydrogen as both an alternative fuel and storage solution for renewable electricity surpluses. The European Union is set to prioritize electrolyzer capacity expansion nearly reaching 400 GW across various scenarios like Distributed Energy (DE) and Global Ambition, with the wholesale electricity market emerging as a primary energy source due to its abundance of low-marginal price hours for power generation.

The EU's hydrogen strategy includes phasing out grey hydrogen by 2050 while boosting production from renewable sources and carbon capture technologies (SMR/ATR with CCS). The integration into the electricity grid, either directly or through hybrid RES systems in proximity to consumption areas without expanding infrastructure further (Dedicated RES), is essential for both securing supply against variability of renewable sources and enhancing overall system flexibility.

In terms of demand-side shifts by 2050, the role hydrogen plays in heating will become more temperature dependent while also contributing to peak electricity demands through dispatched power plants like SMR/ATR with CCS or flexible import terminals that can quickly adjust supply. Storage solutions such as salt caverns and potentially depleted gas fields are expected to be pivotal in balancing the system's increasing imbalance between hydrogen production (which will rely heavily on weather-dependent electrolysis) and consumption patterns, which include variable heating demands based on temperature.

The modeling for this Technology Package 2024 acknowledges that a significant amount of flexibility—up to an order magnitude equivalent to about 180 TWh working gas volume by the year 2050—will be essential in harmonizing hydrogen supply and demand within Europe. However, current estimates may undervalue this requirement since they don't fully account for storage needs; hence actual flexibility capacity could surpass initial projections especially if other sources like conventional production or imports do not provide substantial resilience against extreme climate conditions that affect renewable resource availability.

This evolving landscape positions hydrogen as a cornerstone of Europe’s energy future, requiring strategic investments in electrolyzer technologies",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"By 2050, as we transition towards a sustainable energy future with an emphasis on hydrogen utilization across Europe (EU), it's projected that electrolyzers will achieve substantial capacity expansion nearing approximately 400 GW. This growth is driven primarily by the surplus of renewable electricity and its cost-effectiveness, positioning large-scale power generation as a major supplier to these hydrogen production facilities (electrolysers).

In our examination of two future scenarios—Distributed Energy Ambition and Global Hydrogen Vision—we observe that electrolyzer supply for the EU27 largely originates from renewable sources, with wind energy often being a preferred choice due to its prevalence. The electricity market's wholesale segment is forecasted to be responsible for roughly 81% of hydrogen production in both scenarios by mid-century (Distributed Energy and Global Ambition).

Moreover, the role that renewable energy sources play cannot be overstated; they are not only pivotal during periods when electricity generation costs plummet but also enable localized electrolysis operations. Such locations allow for a direct supply of green hydrogen to end-users without necessitating extensive grid upgrades, thus fostering energy efficiency and reducing transmission losses (hybrid renewable sources).

Another aspect worth noting is that by 2050 in these scenarios, the production from grey or non-renewable methods will cease. This shift aligns with our broader environmental goals to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and transition towards a zero carbon footprint within hydrogen supply chains across Europe (EU).

With respect to system flexibility—an essential component for balancing the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources against fluctuating demand patterns, especially in applications like heating where temperature-dependent consumption occurs—our projections suggest that by 2050 a significant amount of working gas volume (up to an order magnitude increase) will be required. This requirement underscores the necessity for strategically developed storage solutions such as salt caverns and potentially depleted gas fields, which are currently under exploration due to technical challenges yet hold promise in terms of their ability to contribute substantially towards grid stability through energy buffering capabilities"
4,4.4,4.4.3,Netherlands,"In the revised scenario modelling within TYNDP 2024, we explore a hydrogen system that is increasingly characterized by imbalances in supply and demand due to various factors such as temperature-dependent heating applications for renewable hydrogen production via electrolysis (which depends on weather conditions) and peak load times. To meet these demands effectively while ensuring the integration of intermittent RES, we recognize a growing need for flexibility within our system infrastructure—a concept currently illustrated by existing practices in natural gas storage but anticipated to be significantly more pronounced with hydrogen's expansion into diverse applications and markets.

Our analysis indicates that while certain elements such as Small-Scale Modules (SMR) or Ammonia Transportation & Regasification Units (ATRU), along with imports, may offer some degree of flexibility to the system at present, their contribution is limited in scale compared to what will be required. As we project towards 2050, it becomes apparent that a multitude of resources must collectively address this growing demand for flexible hydrogen storage capacity—ranging from salt caverns and potentially depleted gas fields (with ongoing technical challenges) to advanced infrastructure developments like underground or above-ground repositories.

The flexibility needs in our scenario are substantial; we estimate a requirement of upwards of 180 TWh working capacity by the year 2050 for balancing supply and demand effectively across Europe's hydrogen landscape, assuming conventional production methods (including SMR/ATRU) provide only marginal contributions. It is clear from this assessment that our current models may not fully capture these storage requirements; hence we anticipate a potential underestimation by as much as nine-fold if traditional sources cannot deliver the necessary flexibility and climate conditions become more extreme or restrictive geographical connections between nations are established, further amplifying the need for comprehensive hydrogen infrastructure planning.

By focusing on strategic investments in storage solutions along with innovative approaches to grid management that include demand-side response mechanisms among others, we can secure a robust and flexible future energy system capable of integrating renewable sources while meeting Europe's ambitious clean energy transition goals through the use of hydrogen. This will require collaborative efforts across multiple sectors—energy produ",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"In anticipation of a dynamic future, by 2050 Europe's hydrogen infrastructure is projected to evolve significantly with an emphasis on clean and renewable sources:

- **Electrolyzer Capacity**: The EU will see substantial electrolyzer capacity expansion reaching nearly 400 GW. This growth capitalizes primarily on the wholesale electricity market, harnessing periods of low marginal costs driven by surplus from decarbonized generation mixes and renewables proximal to consumption areas (both hybrid RES models).
  
- **Electrolysis Origins**: The majority will be powered through electrolysis using electricity predominantly sourced directly or via close geographic ties with available Renewable Energy Sources, ensuring a green supply chain. A minor fraction of grey hydrogen production is projected to cease by 2050 as the energy landscape transitions towards sustainability.
  
- **System Flexibility**: The future demand and generation within Europe's decarbonized power system will exhibit greater variability, with renewable sources like electrolysis being weather dependent while hydrogen heating applications create seasonal demands based on temperature fluctuations. To accommodate this imbalance between supply-side capability (e.g., SMR/ATR and imports) versus demand peaks or lulls, substantial flexibility is expected:
  
  - **Flexible Storage**: The prevailing approach will necessitate extensive hydrogen storage solutions capable of handling up to an estimated requirement as high as several hundred TWh. While current systems such as salt caverns and potential depleted gas field reserves provide a foundation, the model anticipates these facilities may fall short against full-scale flexibility demands by 2050 without significant advancements in storage technology or infrastructure development (increasing factor up to nine times higher).
  
In summary, Europe's hydrogen strategy is poised for transformation. It will pivot towards clean electricity generation and integrate advanced electrolyzer technologies while emphasizing the pivotal role of strategic flexibility in maintaining a balanced energy system as renewable sources become increasingly variable within their supply dynamics.

4,4.4,4.4.3,Poland,"By 2050, the European Union's transition to a clean hydrogen economy will significantly rely on electrolyzer capacity and renewable energy sources (RES) for production. In scenarios with Distributed Energy Accessibility or Global Ambition targets, it is projected that almost all current grey hydrogen facilities—which have higher carbon emissions due to reliance on fossil fuels without CO2 capture technologies like CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage)—will be phased out. Instead, a vast majority of the electrolysis capacity will come from RES-driven installations connected directly or hybridized with local renewable sources such as wind turbines near consumption areas.

The growth in hydrogen production through these green methods is expected to reach close to 400 GW by mid-century, underlining the critical role of wholesale electricity markets and RES availability for electrolysis operations across EU member states like Poland. This shift towards renewable sources will be complemented with strategic investments in hydrogen storage solutions—such as salt caverns or possibly depleted gas fields, albeit facing certain technical challenges—to handle the system's flexibility needs and bridge supply-demand gaps that arise from weather variability affecting renewable energy production.

Given these strategic developments in hydrogen infrastructure within Europe by 2050:

1. The share of low carbon, or green hydrogen imports will constitute a significant portion (33%) to ensure adequate supply and demand balance for the EU's decarbonized energy mix—significantly impacting Poland as well with its RES resources potentially contributing substantially towards this import volume.
   
2. The decline in grey hydrogen production is a clear indicator of Europe’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions, setting up SMR (Steam Methane Reformers) and ATR facilities without CCS or retrofitted with the technology for continued operation until 2050 as transitional solutions.
   
3. Flexibility in hydrogen storage is identified as a key component of future energy systems to manage imbalances, especially because most current flexibilities stem from sources other than dedicated storage facilities like salt caverns or depleted gas fields—a",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"In anticipation of a transformative energy landscape by 2050, hydrogen emerges as an indispensable element in Europe's decarbonization efforts and supply chain diversification for clean energy markets globally. The scenario analysis conducted underscores the vital role that electrolysers will play: projected to achieve a capacity nearing 400 GW, they are pivotal both within regional boundaries (Distributed Energy) under local renewable resources availability and without grid expansion (Dedicated RES), as well as on an international scale where imports contribute significantly—accounting for nearly one-third of the required decarbonized hydrogen supply.

The transition away from conventional grey hydrogen production is imminent, with all SMR/ATR facilities expected to undergo substantial changes by 2050; either retrofitting or phasing out in favor of low carbon alternatives within Distributed Energy scenarios and a minor residual presence only for global ambition objectives. This shift aligns perfectly with an emerging pattern where hydrogen's role extends beyond mere energy storage to becoming the linchpin that enhances system flexibility amidst variable renewable supply patterns, thus underscoring its significance in complementarity with electric grid fluctuations and temperature-sensitive demand from heating applications.

To fully harness these benefits while addressing uncertainties regarding optimal hydrogen storage capacity—necessary to reconcile the dynamic balance of production versus consumption across Europe's diverse energy landscape—it is critical that future infrastructure investment decisions account for potential underestimations in current models and consider scenarios where conventional sources may not suffice. Given this, there exists a compelling case for upscaling hydrogen storage capabilities to meet the projected flexibility needs of up to 180 TWh by mid-century, potentially increasing requirements significantly due to geographical limitations or climatic extremities that could exacerbate demand imbalances and supply shortfalls.

In light of these insights from scenario modelling for Tyndall Paper No: ETI(24)178/036-EN, policymakers are thus urged to consider a robust infrastructure strategy that includes substantial hydrogen storage solutions in concert with other flexible resources such as SMRs and e-fuels. This"
4,4.4,4.4.3,Portugal,"Portugal's Role in Europe's Hydrogen Storage Strategy by 2050

By integrating hydrogen storage solutions, particularly salt caverns and potentially depleted gas fields, Portugal is anticipated to play a pivotal role within the European Union’s ambitious energy transition. As delineated in our latest TYNDP (Technology Pathways for Net-Zero Deployment) 2024 report, Europe's future hydrogen system will necessitate substantial flexibility—a demand that could reach up to an order of magnitude equivalent to 180 terawatt hours.

Hydrogen storage capacity is critical in balancing the intermittent nature inherent within renewable energy sources and fluctuating demands, especially when considering applications like heating where temperature-dependent requirements prevail alongside weather variability impacting electrolysis production from renewables. The current model suggests that while there are various flexibility contributors such as SMR/ATR (Steam Methane Reformers with Atmospheric Pressure), e-fuel manufacturing, and import terminal operations—these may not suffice to meet the extensive requirements on their own due to economic or technical constraints.

Consequently, Portugal's strategic positioning in utilizing its geological storage potential becomes essential for supplying this needed flexibility within Europe’s hydrogen marketplace by 2050. The model indicates that without sufficient contribution from conventional production and imports towards the goal of providing necessary system balance through flexible energy sources like salt caverns, Portugal's role could be even more crucial than initially projected—possibly up to nine times greater if there are limitations in inter-country connections or extreme climate events.

In summary, as Europe advances toward a sustainable and decarbonized future powered by hydrogen energy storage systems like salt caverns (and potentially depleted gas fields), Portugal's geographical advantage places it at the forefront of fulfilling this critical component in ensuring grid stability across diverse scenarios. This underscores an urgent need for comprehensive planning and investment to unlock hydrogen’s full potential as a cornerstone resource within Europe, with Portugal leading by example through its strategic utilization of natural resources aligned with global ambitions toward net",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"Portugal's role within Europe's future energy landscape is poised to evolve significantly by 2050, particularly in relation to hydrogen production and storage for enhanced system flexibility:

- Hydrogen Production from Renewables (HR): Portugal aims at leveraging its abundant renewable resources such as solar power. By the year 2050, it is expected that an impressive capacity of nearly 38 GW will be dedicated to electrolysis for hydrogen production directly through photovoltaic systems and wind energy sources (Figure: Electrolyser Capacity in Portugal). This aligns with a broader European strategy where the EU27 anticipates reaching up to almost half its total electricity demand, 40% of which could be supplied by renewable electrolytics.
  
- Demand for Hydrogen and Storage: The hydrogen system's flexibility requirement in Portugal will reach a staggering volume equivalent to approximately 18 TWh working gas capacity (Figure: Portuguese Flexibility Requirement). This figure illustrates the extensive storage needs necessary due to variability in renewable supply, with current models suggesting underestimation. If conventional production and imports contribute minimally towards this flexibility requirement, Portugal may need hydrogen infrastructure capable of meeting a factor up to nine times greater than currently projected for scenarios such as Distributed Energy or Global Ambition (Figure: Hydrogen Flexibility).
  
- Strategic Import & Export Potential: Given its geographical location and renewable energy potential, Portugal is positioning itself not just on the production side but also within Europe's hydrogen trade network. The country could play a pivotal role in importing or exporting green ammonia (Figure 35), potentially serving as both an exporter of low-carbon resources and importer to balance regional supply gaps during peak demand periods, thereby contributing significantly towards the diversification of Europe's hydrogen portfolio.
  
In summary, Portugal envisions a future where renewable electrolytic capacity is integrated seamlessly with robust storage solutions that ensure flexibility across its electricity and gas networks—a cornerstone for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 in concert with the EU's ambitions."
4,4.4,4.4.3,Romania,"In anticipation of a diversified and global clean hydrogen market, EU countries are expected to see substantial growth in electrolyzer capacity by 2050—nearing an impressive total of nearly 400 GW. This expansion leverages the abundant renewable energy sources within Europe alongside strategic imports that contribute significantly (33%) towards a combined hydrogen supply and demand adequacy, amounting to about 981 TWh in decarbonized form by mid-century.

The integration of electrolyzers into both Distributed Energy scenarios—and further amplified under the Global Ambition scenario—highlights their reliance on surplus renewable electricity and strategic placement, either near existing RES (renewables) or in dedicated infrastructure designed solely for hydrogen production. This positioning minimizes transmission losses while optimizing local energy resources utilization:
- Hybrid RE systems facilitate direct electrolysis where feasible; otherwise, they connect to the broader wholesale market and hydrogens grid network without necessitating additional infrastructure expansion (dedicated RES).
  
By 2050 in both scenarios—and even more pronounced within Global Ambition's framework —the majority of hydrogen production will have shifted away from traditional grey sources, phasing them out completely. Electrolyzers are set to dominate the renewable supply chain for early-stage transition phases and beyond:
- In Distributed Energy scenarios, SMR/ATR (Small Modular Reactors or Advanced Turbine Units) without carbon capture will be decommissioned unless retrofitted with CCS technology by 2030. A fractional presence of low greenhouse gas emitting hydrogen production persists until the end goal is achieved, particularly in Global Ambition scenarios where a minimal yet strategic contribution from SMRs equipped with carbon capture remains operational past mid-century (5 TWh).
  
The evolving role and system integration demands of hydrogen within Europe's energy framework underscore its dual function as both an essential input for decarbonization efforts, particularly in the early stages when low greenhouse gas emitting sources are prevalent. Hydrogen will also serve a pivotal part—increasing flexibility and contributing to grid stability by",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"In alignment with TYNDP 2024, we've modeled a future hydrogen system that requires substantial flexibility to balance supply and demand by 2050—up to an estimated need for up to 180 terawatt-hours (TWh) of working gas volume. Currently, the model indicates most required flexibility is met through sources other than storage facilities due to economic or technical constraints that may limit their capacity in providing such extensive support. However, it's critical to note potential underestimation; if conventional production and imports are not substantial contributors (and possibly only offer minimal flexible response), we could see the actual hydrogen storage requirement increase significantly—by a factor of up to 9 times higher than projected for various scenarios. This revised understanding underscores challenges such as inter-country connectivity limitations, extreme climate variations over time further compounding these requirements and highlighting an urgent need for adequate investment in hydrogen storage infrastructure across Europe."
4,4.4,4.4.3,Sweden,"By 2050, Europe's transition to a clean energy system heavily relies on hydrogen as both an essential supply element and key for achieving flexibility within its electricity grid amidst varying renewable outputs and demand patterns. Here are the refined insights into how this integration takes shape:

- **Global Hydrogen Supply**: The EU's clean energy vision is underpinned by a significant hydrogen supply from domestic production, with imported resources complementing its needs to ensure adequacy of 981 TWh. This import share constitutes nearly one third (33%) of the total demand for decarbonized and renewable hydrogen in Europe.
  
- **Electrolysis Capacity Growth**: To meet future energy demands, electrolysers are set to expand considerably by 2050—reaching a capacity nearing 400 gigawatt (GW) across Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios. The wholesale electricity market is expected to be the predominant supplier for these facilities due to low marginal costs from renewable generation, with local availability of resources also supporting hydrogen production in certain regions via hybrid or dedicated systems without requiring grid expansion (either connected directly through RES like wind/solar parks and salt caverns storage).
  
- **Transition Away From Grey Hydrogen**: In alignment with environmental goals, all grey hydrogen—produced from fossil fuels using steam methane reforming without carbon capture technology (SMR / ATR)—will be phased out by 2050. Alternatives include retrofitting existing facilities to integrate CCS or transitioning entirely away in favor of renewable sources and SMR/ATR equipped with Carbon Capture Storage, as per national strategies where available until the decommissioned phase begins post-years 2030 within Distributed Energy scenarios.
  
- **Hydrogen's Systemic Role**: The integration of hydrogen into Europe’s energy mix will not only meet decarbonization targets but also enhance system flexibility, particularly in response to the variable nature of renewable power generation and consumption patterns such as heating demands. This is expected to be critical for maintaining",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"By 2050, Europe's energy landscape is set to undergo a transformative shift with hydrogen playing an increasingly pivotal role in meeting both decarbonization goals and ensuring supply adequacy amidst varying renewable outputs. The European Union (EU) anticipates that nearly half of its clean electricity will be sourced from electrolysis, facilitating the production of hydrogen to reach a capacity close to 400 GW—a testament to Europe's commitment towards sustainability and energy independence.

The EU27 is projected to import approximately one-third (33%) of its decarbonized renewable hydrogen, amounting to around 981 TWh by mid-century. This strategic move not only bolsters the domestic supply mix but also underscores Europe's reliance on global partnerships for a robust clean energy infrastructure that mitigates greenhouse gas emissions and strengthens economic resilience in renewable resource management.

Electrolysers, powered primarily by low marginal-cost wholesale electricity from the decarbonization of Europe's generation mix—and augmented with localized resources such as hybrid RE (renewable energy) sources and dedicated RES facilities for hydrogen production without grid expansion—will lead this green transition. By 2050, electrolysers are expected to account for a significant portion of their electricity supply in both the Distributed Energy scenario and Global Ambition modeling framework, underlining an integrated approach where energy systems intertwine with clean hydrogen production seamlessly across Europe's diverse landscapes.

A key aspect that emerges from these projections is a phased retirement of grey (high-carbon) SMR/ATR without carbon capture and storage, replaced by low or zero emissions alternatives in line with the EU’s climate commitments—a scenario where even minimal hydrogen production via retrofitted CCS facilities persists.

Looking ahead to 2050 within these scenarios reveals that high-carbon SMR/ATR will be nearly extinct, replaced by a predominantly low carbon and renewable energy landscape for Europe's decarbonized hydrogen supply chain—an alignment with the overarching"
4,4.4,4.4.3,Slovenia,"In preparation for TYNDP 2024, scenario modeling has been undertaken to evaluate hydrogen's role in Europe’s energy system up until 2050: a pivotal timeframe aimed at achieving carbon neutrality. The analysis delves into various aspects of the burgeoning clean hydrogen market including production methods (renewable and low-carbon sources), supply dynamics, storage requirements for flexibility in balancing demand with intermittent renewable energy supplies, as well as strategic import considerations to complement domestic capacities.

The scenarios project a significant expansion of electrolysis capacity across the EU27 region—peaking at nearly 400 GW by mid-century. This growth is driven largely from decarbonized electricity generation and low marginal cost periods, whereby wholesale markets become prime providers for hydrogen production via direct coupling or hybrid systems that utilize both renewable energy sources (RES) nearby consumption centers as well as dedicated RES installations.

The transition away from grey hydrogen—derived solely through fossil fuels without carbon capture and storage—is marked by a complete phasing-out of Small Modular Reactors/Atom Power Plants in favor of SMRs with CCS or direct replacements, reflecting the commitment to sustainable practices.

Storage plays an integral role as it emerges from current methane system flexibility strategies; hydrogen storage is envisioned through existing salt caverns and potentially depleted gas fields—though technical challenges remain for large-scale implementation by 2050. The modeling anticipates a need to store upwards of 180 TWh in working gas volume, which may be underestimated due to the limited flexibility contribution from conventional hydrogen supply and import sources within scenarios presented herein—indicating that actual storage needs might exceed current projections by as much as nine times.

The study acknowledges existing constraints such as cross-border connectivity limits between countries, which could further amplify required storage capacity in the face of extreme weather events or unanticipated shifts within climate patterns. These considerations underscore a pivotal need for robust hydrogen infrastructure development and strategic planning to accommodate future demand while ens",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"In anticipation of a transformative energy landscape by 2050, hydrogen's evolving role in Europe is underpinned by significant growth and diversification within both Distributed Energy scenarios (DE) and Global Ambition framework. The strategic development envisages an electrolyser capacity expansion nearing the impressive figure of 400 GW across EU27 territories, with a substantial reliance on renewable energy sources for electricity supply to power these facilities—accounting for approximately 81% in DE and retaining significant support until mid-century even under Global Ambition.

The hydrogen market will increasingly lean toward low carbon production methods by phasing out grey hydrogen entirely, with all Small Modular Reactors (SMR) or Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Reformers without Carbon Capture and Storage either retrofitted for sustainability or replaced in the near term. A strategic pivot will occur wherein SMR/ATR capacities dwindle by 2050, with Global Ambition reflecting a minor residual of low carbon hydrogen production through advanced technologies like Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS).

A pivotal aspect is the enhanced flexibility requirement within Europe's future energy system. The anticipated fluctuations in supply-demand dynamics, influenced by renewable feedstock variability and evolving hydrogen demand patterns—notably for heating applications sensitive to temperature changes—will necessitate robust storage solutions alongside other flexible resources like imports or e-fuels production capacity.

The modeling within this TYNDP 2024 scenario reveals a substantial requirement of up to approximately 180 Terawatt hours (TWh) in working gas volume by the year 2050, indicative of hydrogen's central role as both energy carrier and system flexibility provider. However, there is an acknowledged limitation: conventional production sources may not suffice for this demand level due to economic or technical constraints. Consequently, a reassessment suggests that the actual storage capacity required could be upwards by factors of 8-9 compared to current estimations in both scenarios—with additional pressures from regional connectivity and extreme climatic events further amplifying these needs.

This analysis underscores hydrogen's critical infrastr"
4,4.4,4.4.3,Slovakia,"By 2050, Europe's strategic energy landscape will be significantly shaped by an ambitious hydrogen economy that integrates renewable production and clean imports to meet its decarbonization goals. The EU aims for substantial electrolyzer capacity growth—approaching nearly 400 GW—to capitalize on low marginal costs of wholesale electricity, especially during periods with high levels of RES availability close to consumption areas or dedicated renewable sources like hybrid RE+ and Dedicated RE.

In this context:
- The electrolyzer capacity for the EU27 will rise dramatically by 2050 due in part to advancements driven both by low carbon hydrogen demand during early transition phases, which secures renewable supply chains (81% of electricity from wholesale market and hybrid RES), as well as direct connections with the grid through dedicated RE.
- All gray SMR/ATR facilities will be phased out or retrofitted by 2050 in compliance with carbon capture strategies, leaving a negligible footprint of only about 5 TWh from those equipped with CCS technology within Global Ambition scenarios. The future hydrogen system is expected to increasingly rely on flexible resources beyond SMR/ATR and imports; this includes energy storage capabilities (e.g., salt caverns, depleted gas fields), demand-side response mechanisms like e-fuel production shifts in alignment with renewable availability or other forms of flexibility sources that could serve to balance the supply–demand equation for hydrogen on an hourly basis up to 180 TWh by mid-century.

The evolving role and scale of storage within Europe's energy sector is highlighted, recognizing current models may underestimate actual requirements due to potential limitations in conventional flexibility sources like SMR/ATR or import terminals—which might not provide the level needed for balancing supply with demand as robustly. This calls attention to a possible recalibration of hydrogen storage needs by an order factor upwards from current estimates, particularly when considering extreme weather events and constraints in cross-border connections among EU nations that further exacerbate flexibility demands within its energy ecosystems like Slovakia's strategic positioning",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"In anticipation of a robust European Hydrogen Market by 2050, strategic developments are essential for enhancing access to both global and regional clean hydrogen sources. The EU's projected supply mix includes approximately 2083 TWh from renewable resources with an emphasis on decarbonized imports amounting to nearly 981 TWh—accounting for a significant import share of about one-third (33%).

The widespread deployment and scalability of electrolyzers are critical, forecasted at near 400 GW capacity by the midpoint of this century. The overwhelming majority will be powered primarily through wholesale electricity markets due to high renewable generation availability during off-peak hours—reaching an estimated provision for electrolysers from these sources in both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios at 81%.

Strategically, the integration of hydrogen production is complemented by local Renewables (RES) infrastructure. This includes hybrid systems that connect to RES-rich areas as well as direct links without expanding electricity grid capacity—known collectively as Dedicated RES setups. By 2050, it's projected all grey hydrogen production will cease with the transition towards clean alternatives.

Flexibility within this evolving market is paramount and necessitates substantial working gas storage volumes to balance supply fluctuations—estimated at a need upwards of 180 TWh by mid-century for both scenarios, Distributed Energy & Global Ambition alike. While current hydrogen production methods like SMR/ATR offer some flexibility and imports contribute marginally in the short term, long-term sustainability demands significant advancements towards storage solutions such as salt caverns or potential expansion into depleted gas fields—facilities that are yet to overcome certain technological challenges.

The scenario modeling for this Technology Package (TYNDP) 2024 acknowledges the varied flexibility sources in Europe's hydrogen landscape, including SMR/ATR and e-fuel production among others. It is imperative that these models are continuously refined to more accurately reflect storage needs as conventional methods alone prove insufficient for ach"

The evolution forecast for electrolyzers suggests a surge nearing an impressive capacity of approximately 400 GW, heavily relying on the wholesale electricity market and renewable resources in proximity to consumption areas (hybrid RES) or directly connected hydrogen grids without necessitating additional grid expansions.

By this mid-century deadline for emissions reduction targets, all small modular reactors (SMRs)/advanced technologies relying on natural gas (ATRs) lacking carbon capture and storage are slated to phase out or be retrofitted with CCS technology—a process expected by 2030. This transition will result in the cessation of grey hydrogen production, paving the way for a predominant low-carbon energy landscape dominated initially by renewable sources and imports but gradually increasing contributions from SMRs/ATR retrofits with CCS technology—though only small quantities (5 TWh) will remain in Global Ambition scenarios.

The hydrogen system's flexibility is anticipated to grow, reflecting fluctuating demand patterns influenced by seasonal variations and renewable supply unpredictability due to weather conditions. Storage capabilities are expected to become crucial for maintaining this balance; however, current models may underestimate the required storage capacity—which might be up to nine times higher than projected scenarios suggest (up to 180 TWh) if conventional production and imports only provide limited flexibility or in cases of more extreme climate events. This underscores a potential need for increased investment into hydrogen storage solutions, such as salt caverns—a technology already demonstrated today—and possibly expanding on the use of depleted gas fields once technical challenges are addressed.

In summary, by 2050 Europe's clean energy landscape will be characterized not only by a significant increase in renewable electricity generation and electrolyzer deployment but also an evolved hydrogen infrastructure that emphasizes storage flexibility to manage the dynamic supply",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"In this TYNDP 2024 scenario analysis, we explore hydrogen's evolving role within Europe’s energy landscape by examining various production scenarios and their impact on supply chain dynamics from 2030 to 2050:

1. **Electrolyzer Expansion**: The European Union aims for significant growth in electrolyzer capacity, anticipating installations reaching nearly 400 GW by mid-century (in Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios). This surge is largely powered by renewable sources like wind or solar. Both wholesale electricity markets – where excess low marginal cost energy fuels electrolysis during periods of high RES generation - and dedicated, localized Renewable Power Source (RES) facilities are pivotal in this growth phase until 2050; only the latter may offer a direct supply chain without needing grid expansion.

2. **Zero-Carbon Hydrogen Production**: By the target date of 2050 in both scenarios under Distributed Energy and Global Ambition approaches, all grey hydrogen production will be phased out completely due to its high carbon emissions profile compared with low or renewable sources like electrolysis.
   
   *Figure 35*: The source of electricity for future EU-wide hydrogen supply (not provided).

3. **System Role and Flexibility**: Hydrogen is increasingly recognized as a flexible energy carrier, providing storage capability that can balance the grid during peak demand or when intermittent renewable sources underperform due to weather conditions. While some flexibility might be offered by SMR/ATR (with CCS retrofits), e-fuels production from electrolysis, and strategic imports of green hydrogen – salt cavern storage is the primary method for balancing supply with demand on an hourly basis in our modeled scenarios. However, there's a significant gap between current flexibility levels provided by these sources versus what would be required to fully stabilize Europe’s future energy system; it indicates that substantial hydrogen storage capacity will likely need"
4,4.4,4.4.3,summary,"In the Distributed Energy scenario, by 2050 electrolyzers will operate at close to full capacity of nearly 400 GW, largely powered by renewables from wholesale electricity markets and hybrid or dedicated RES installations. This results in a significant decarbonized hydrogen supply with an import share accounting for about one-third (33%) of the EU's total demand (2083 TWh). The transition away from grey hydrogen is complete, phasing out all SMR/ATR without CCS by 2050.

Under Global Ambition with a high penetration of renewables and storage solutions like salt caverns or depleted gas fields for flexibility needs (up to an order magnitude of up to 180 TWh), we still anticipate potential underestimation in hydrogen storage requirements due to limited other sources' ability. This implies that the actual requirement could be as much as nine times higher than initially projected, necessitating substantial investments and advancements in geographic connectivity between countries for efficient balancing of supply-demand dynamics amidst varying weather conditions or extreme climate scenarios.

Figure 36 Hydrogen Flexibility & Figure 37 depict the scaled need for hydrogen storage to maintain system balance, highlighting that while SMR/ATR and imports contribute some flexibility in both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition pathways, a significant portion of required energy must be stored. The importance of robust infrastructure development is emphasized as these systems will not only supply decarbonised hydrogen but also enable critical system stability through flexible storage capabilities for an increasingly imbalanced renewable-driven electricity market and the evolving demand patterns in sectors such as heating, which are temperature sensitive.",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Grid Flows,"In developing a robust framework to meet Europe's clean energy objectives by 2050, hydrogen emerges as an integral player in both local and global markets with its production increasingly reliant on renewables (RE) due to their low marginal cost. By this year, the EU anticipates importing nearly one-third of decarbonised RE hydrogen—amounting to 981 TWh —from various regions like North Africa or Asia and contributing significantly toward maintaining supply chain equilibrium in a transitioned energy landscape characterized by intermittent renewable sources.

The projection for electrolysis technology shows substantial growth, with capacities nearing an impressive 400 GW across Europe's Distributed Energy systems (DE) and Global Ambition scenarios—signaling the crucial role of wholesale electricity markets as primary energy inputs to meet this surge. The strategic placement in proximate RES areas allows for either hybrid integration with nearby renewable sources or direct connection, devoid of additional grid expansions (Dedicated RE).

In alignment with stringent decarbonization targets—phasing out all grey hydrogen production by 2050 and transitioning to SMR/ATR equipped with carbon capture technologies where available within the established CCS strategies. Despite a decrease in low-carbon Hydrogen supplies as we progress towards Global Ambition, small quantities of retrofitted facilities will persist post-decommission or replacement by higher efficiency units devoid of emissions.

The evolving hydrogen infrastructure is poised to enhance systemic flexibility—a critical aspect given the variable nature intrinsic to renewable energy sources and consumer demand patterns, such as heating requirements which are temperature sensitive. Storage solutions like salt caverns currently in use will remain pivotal; however, larger-scale alternatives for long duration storage might encompass depleted gas fields subjected to ongoing technological refinement challenges.

4,4.4,4.4.4,summary,"By 2050, Europe's energy landscape will be dominated by a robust supply of hydrogen from renewable sources and strategic imports to ensure adequate balance between production and demand in various scenarios modeled for TYNDP 2024. The electricity market is anticipated as the primary source fueling electrolyzers, with significant developments expected across both Distributed Energy (DE) systems within Europe's borders—where localized renewable energy sources directly support hydrogen production via hybrid or dedicated RES strategies to reduce reliance on external infrastructure expansion—and in Global Ambition scenarios that account for trans-border trade.

The transition away from grey hydrogen is clear, with a complete phaseout by 2050 under both scenario models; instead, electrolysis will harness abundant renewable electricity while SMR/ATR without carbon capture technologies (CCS) are scheduled for decommissioning or retrofitting. Notably in DE systems and to some extent Global Ambition scenarios as well, low-carbon hydrogen is pivotal during the initial phases of this energy shift but will gradually give way over time due to more extensive deployment of electrolysis powered by sustainable generation sources.

Flexibility within Europe's future hydrogen system faces considerable uncertainty regarding optimal resource allocation and geographical distribution, with a strong consensus that storage solutions—particularly salt caverns which are already established in practice today as well as prospective developments like depleted gas fields (which face technical challenges) will be crucial. The current model underestimates the need for hydrogen storage capacity; without sufficient flexibility from conventional production and imports, or due to geographical constraints on interconnections between countries coupled with extreme climate events that may exacerbate demand fluctuations, it's projected there will be an upwards revision in required volume of working gas by a factor as high as ninefold.

These scenarios underscore the need for strategic planning and investment into hydrogen infrastructure to support Europe’s energy transition goals—with particular attention paid towards developing storage capacities that can buffer supply-demand imbalances, ensuring sustainability targets are met while maintaining system reliability.",Modelling Results,Hydrogen,Hydrogen Storage,"By 2050, Europe's transition to a clean energy system will heavily rely on hydrogen as both an integral part of its renewable supply and for enhancing grid flexibility. The European Union (EU) is set to become the leading global market in terms of decarbonized hydrogen production from renewables, aiming at importing upwards of 981 TWh - a third of all EU demand. This ambitious goal will be powered by an extensive network of electrolysers with capacities nearing 400 GW, predominantly sourced energy-wise and strategically placed close to renewable resources or within hydrogen grids for direct use (Distributed Energy) as well as from wholesale electricity markets.

The scenarios modelled in the TYNDP 2024 reflect a shift away from grey hydrogen production, with all Small-Scale Modular Reactors/Advanced Technologies Reactor without carbon capture and storage (SMR / ATR) either phased out or retrofitted by mid-century. This transition underscores the EU's commitment to decarbonization across its energy mix while recognizing that SMR with Carbon Capture Storage may still have a role, albeit minimal in 2050 scenarios like Global Ambition where only about 5 TWh of such hydrogen supply remains.

The evolving demand for renewable and dispatched low-carbon hydrogen is expected to outstrip that from traditional gas systems due to the increasing integration into heating, transportation, industry processes, and as a means to provide system flexibility in response to weather fluctuations or peak electricity demands.

Hydrogen storage emerges as an indispensable component for balancing supply with demand throughout Europe's energy landscape by 2050 - the scenario models anticipate upwards of 180 TWh working gas volume in hydrogen form may be required to maintain system equilibrium, suggesting that current model assumptions might underestimate actual storage needs. The limitations here are twofold: technical hurdles and existing infrastructure constraints limiting flexibility from sources other than dedicated storage facilities like salt caverns or potentially depleted natural gas fields.

In the broader context of energy systems, hydrogen's role extends"
4,4.5,4.5.1,Austria,"In accordance with Figure 32, we observe a comprehensive analysis of methane supplies across various scenarios within TYNDP 2024 frameworks for Austria and other EU member states by 2050. Each scenario reflects an anticipated decline in conventional indigenous natural gas production to zero during this period. Specifically:
- By the year 2040, there is a projected reduction of methane output by approximately 31% relative to National Trends+ baseline predictions for that timeframe; however, more aggressive targets are set in both DE (decarbonization) and GA scenarios with reductions reaching upwards of 47%.
- The integration of indigenous renewable methane sources is tailored according to scenario specifics. In the National Trends+ modeling, biomethane generation sees a progressive uptick over time while synthetic production via electrolytic methods remains comparatively modest yet essential for meeting overall supply demands and achieving carbon neutrality by mid-century (2050).
  
Biomethane emerges as the predominant force in renewable methane decarbonization strategies, signifying its pivotal role within both deviation scenarios. It is complemented significantly by synthetic counterparts to fulfill supply requirements and attain carbon-neutral milestones for energy systems.
  
The importation of natural gas sees a complete cessation in all evaluated pathways leading up to 2050, underpinning the transition towards sustained self-sufficiency with renewable methane resources—a fundamental shift critical for policy makers and stakeholders within energy sectors.
  
In particular scenarios like Distributed Energy (DE), indigenous production of decarbonized alternatives falls to 920 TWh by the year 2050, with synthetic methane contributions slightly exceeding those in Global Ambition models at approximately 285 TWh. Biomethane remains a substantial component but assumes lesser significance relative to these figures (around 635 TWh). Notably absent are imports of natural gas by the year's end within DE scenarios, underscored as an integral part of Austria’s energy transition strategy towards global market engagement and",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"In assessing methane dynamics within TYNDP 2024 scenarios, it becomes evident that a consistent trajectory towards zero conventional indigenous natural gas production by 2050 is projected across all modelled pathways. Notably, there exists an anticipated reduction in traditional methane output of approximately 31% come the year 2040 compared to National Trends+ projections for 2030—with more aggressive cuts envisioned under DE and GA scenarios at rates reaching upwards of 47% and 40%, respectively.

The landscape diverges when examining renewable methane sources, such as biomethane derived from organic waste or synthetic variants produced via electrolytic processes—both integral components within the broader decarbonisation narrative for these scenarios. National Trends+ portrays an upward trend in sustainably sourced biomethane over time, while acknowledging that current synthetic methane production through such technology remains modestly scaled until a significant ramp-up is anticipated toward the midpoint of the century.

The collective output from renewable and decarbonised gases in these scenarios serves as an adequate buffer to offset conventional declines, positioning biomethane atop its pivotal role within methane supply chains for achieving substantial carbon emission reductions by 2050. This is mirrored across both deviation and ambition pathways alike wherein synthetic alternatives are earmarked as critical to supplementary demand, thus propelling the energy sector towards a net-zero emissions horizon within this timeframe.

Focusing on Austrian policy implications under scenarios like Distributed Energy (DE) versus Global Ambition (GA), we observe distinct profiles of methane supply composition by 2050: DE expects indigenous renewable and decarbonised sources to contribute around 920 TWh, with synthetic production marginally exceeding that in GA scenarios at approximately 285 TWh. In contrast, biomethane's contribution is estimated slightly lower but remains significant within the Austrian context—around 635 TWh by year-end of this period; a testament to Austria"
4,4.5,4.5.1,Belgium,"In alignment with Figure 32, methane provision across three TYNDP 2024 scenarios demonstrates a consistent trend towards cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production by mid-century (2050).

The Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios project more aggressive cuts: DE scenario exhibits a 47% decline while GA forecasts a noteworthy decrease of around 40%.

The composition mix for indigenous renewable methane, including biomethane derivatives from organic sources and synthetic alternatives generated through electrolytic processes, is subject to variation depending on each scenario's strategies. Under the National Trends+ projection model, there’s an observable trend towards augmented production of bio-derived gases over time with a relatively modest contribution from electrically produced methane synthesis by 2050. Collectively, these renewable sources are projected to balance out and effectively mitigate the reduction in conventional natural gas supplies within this period frame.

Biomethane emerges as an indispensable element for transitioning towards sustainability of methane supply chains—predominantly driving decarbonization efforts across both deviation scenarios, with synthetic methane also identified to play a complementary role in achieving carbon neutrality targets by 2050.

With respect to the Global Ambition scenario that emphasizes EU integration within global energy reformative measures and market diversification—the projection indicates substantial reduction of natural gas imports down to zero, attributable largely to enhanced domestic renewable methane production (1078 TWh in 2050). Energy efficiency advancements contribute further by reducing import volumes progressively until reaching a negligible level.

In the Distributed Energy scenario—characterized by lesser indigenous generation of alternative, low-carbon gases but with an emphasis on decentralization and local production capabilities (920 TWh in 2050) —there is also no expectation for natural gas importation post-204",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"In Figure 32, we observe a comprehensive overview of methane availability under various scenarios projected for TYNDP 2024 within Belgium's energy landscape. It is anticipated that conventional indigenous natural gas production will decline significantly and reach zero by the year 2050 across all considered futures. By contrast, in a near-term assessment of methane supply dynamics for 2040—when juxtaposed with National Trends+ benchmarks established in 2030—there is an expected reduction ranging from approximately 31% to as high as 47%, depending on the scenario. Notably, both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios exhibit a commitment to ambitious decreases through enhanced biomethane production alongside synthetic methane advancements via electrolysis technologies.

Biomethane emerges as an indispensable pillar for the sustainable transition of our energy systems, with its substantial contribution towards decarbonizing natural gas supplies being evident in both deviation scenarios by 2050. The role it plays is complemented further through synthetic methane development—a strategic element essential to achieving a carbon-neutral status within the same timeframe.

In alignment with our ambitious climate targets, imports of conventional natural gas are projected to cease entirely by 2050 in all scenarios examined. The Distributed Energy scenario anticipates renewable and decarbonized methane production at about 920 TWh for the year 2050—a figure that underscores a modest but meaningful reliance on domestic sources, even as it signals minimal import requirements by mid-century. Conversely, in our Global Ambition scenario, which aspires towards both high decarbonization levels and access to diversified international markets for renewable methane options (expecting an output of 1078 TWh), energy efficiency initiatives are projected to further reduce import reliance by the year 2040.

Figure 32 succinctly captures these projections and underscores Belgium's commitment towards a decarbonized, self-sufficient methane supply that is intricately"
4,4.5,4.5.1,Bulgaria,"In Figure 32, we examine methane availability across various scenarios within TYNDP 2024 projections for EU energy policy development. By mid-century (2050), there is an anticipated cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production; however, this trend commences with a significant contraction—31% by the year 2040 relative to National Trends+ projections for that timeframe. The DE and GA scenarios project more rigorous declines at rates surpassing initial expectations: specifically, reductions of 47% in Denmark (DE) and a noteworthy decrease of approximately 40% globally (GA).

Shifts toward indigenous renewable methane sources—such as biomethane derived from organic waste streams or synthetic alternatives produced via electrolysis processes—are integral to these projections. National Trends+ illustrates a trajectory of escalating reliance on such technologies, with an emphasis placed upon the ascending production volumes for both categories by 2050; this is essential in bridging gaps left vacant due to conventional natural gas diminutions and propelling toward carbon neutrality.

Biomethane emerges as a cornerstone of renewable methane supply, offering substantial potentials for decarbonization within the energy sector's portfolio under both deviation scenarios (DE-Adapted & GA). Its role is further solidified in tandem with synthetic gas advancements—the latter being pivotal to fulfilling residual methane supply requirements and achieving a balanced carbon footprint.

By the year 2050, these scenarios project that import reliance will have been entirely phased out for indigenous production of renewable energy sources within all considered pathways—a testament to Europe's commitment toward self-sufficiency and environmental stewardship in its methane supply chain.

In particular contextualization, the Distributed Energy scenario (DE) forecasts a relatively modest indigenous output of renewable/decarbonized natural gas at 920 TWh by midcentury's end—with synthetic production estimated to slightly exceed this figure and biomethane contribution nearing half",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"In Figure 32, we present a comprehensive analysis of methane supplies across various scenarios within TYNDP 2024 frameworks for EU member states such as Bulgaria. By mid-century (2050), conventional indigenous natural gas production is anticipated to cease entirely in all considered cases. Notably, by the year 2040 there will be a marked decrease of approximately 31% compared with levels projected under National Trends+ for 2030; however, scenarios DE and GA showcase more aggressive targets—reducing production by an additional 7%.

The landscape shifts towards renewable methane sources: biomethane is set to escalate as a cornerstone in the transition process. In tandem with synthetic methods of gas generation, particularly through electrolysis advancements, these alternative forms will collectively offset declining traditional natural gas reserves by 2050—achieving full decarbonization and contributing to carbon neutrality objectives across scenarios DE (47%) and GA (40%).

Focusing on Bulgaria's context within the Distributed Energy scenario, renewable methane production will reach around 920 TWh by mid-century. Synthetic alternatives are projected to slightly surpass this figure at approximately 285 TWh in contrast with GA scenarios; biomethane remains significant but less dominant than its synthetic counterparts (~635 TWh). Import levels, reflecting the shift towards self-sufficiency and reduced reliance on external supplies by year 2040—and ultimately eliminating imports entirely come 2050.

The Global Ambition scenario positions Bulgaria within an ambitious framework that not only champions high decarbonisation rates but also leverages the benefits of diversified global markets for renewable methane by-products (projected at roughly 1,078 TWh in 2050). This strategy is further reinforced through strategic energy efficiency measures which significantly lower projected imports down to just under a thousand megatons by the year of our assessment.

In summary, Bulgaria's journey towards an integrated and sustainable methane supply chain within TYNDP "
4,4.5,4.5.1,Cyprus,"Cyprus Energy Outlook Report - Section Overview on Methane Supply Transition (2050 Targets)

Figure 32 illustrates projected methane supply trends across three key TYNDP scenarios by the year 2040 and zero-emissions benchmark in Cyprus. The trajectory anticipates a universal decline to cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production, expected fully phased out by midcentury (2050).

Comparatively speaking: By our decade mark projection for 2040, there is an envisaged contraction in methane output relative to the National Trends+ baseline of year 2030—a significant decrease marked at approximately a third. This reduction intensifies under scenarios DE and GA (Decarbonization Endeavor) with respective curtailments reaching upwards of forty-seven percent for scenario Delta, showcasing our ambitious drive towards renewable sources.

The spectrums within these projections reveal varying levels in the burgeoning field of indigenous methane—namely biomethane and synthetic varieties derived from electrolytic processes (synthetics). The National Trends+ model forecasts a steady augmentation, particularly for natural-originated bioenergy. However, our electrified future is anticipatory; with modest contributions expected via the production of synthesized methane in both scenarios through 2050.

Biomethane stands as Cyprus's cornerstone within this renewable landscape—pivotal for achieving a substantial decarbonization leap and serving as an underpinning resource throughout our strategic narratives (DE & GA). Its role is complemented by synthetic methane, emerging not only as supplementary but also crucial in striving toward net-zero emissions milestones.

Foreseeing a future devoid of imports to align with 2050 climate commitments across both scenarios underscores the robustness and resilience inherent within Cyprus's methane infrastructure evolution—a testament to our strategic foresight in energy policy design. The Distributed Energy scenario particularly emphasizes a lower output of indigenous renew",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"This report examines methane dynamics within three distinct TYNDP 2024 scenarios, focusing on their respective pathways to achieving a zero-emission target by mid-century (2050). All projected trajectories converge upon the cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production. By this juncture—specifically in 2040—there is an anticipated contraction, with national levels falling to a third compared against National Trends+ projections for that same year (a reduction by approximately one-third).

In the Distributed Energy scenario, renewable and decarbonized methane output presents modestly at 920 TWh in 2050. Herein lies an increased reliance on synthetic options compared to Global Ambition scenarios—projected production reaches roughly 285 TWh by the same date. Notably, biomethane emerges as a substantial contributor within this scenario framework but occupies less visibility than its counterparts; it is estimated at about 635 TWh in total output for that future year. By contrast, import reliance plummets to non-existence by the decade's end under Distributed Energy assumptions—a stark reflection of self-sufficiency goals and a transition away from traditional energy sourcing modalities.

Conversely, Global Ambition envisages an integrated EU approach that not only champions high decarbonization rates but also capitalizes on international access to renewable methane markets—a projected 1078 TWh by the year of cessation in our baseline scenario. Concurrently implemented energy efficiency strategies are expected to further diminish import needs, bringing them down significantly from their mid-century benchmarks (to an estimated total of 1119 TWh). In this visionary context, natural gas imports ultimately vanish by the year marking a new era—2050.

4,4.5,4.5.1,Czech Republic,"In Figure 32, we present an analysis of methane availability across various scenarios within TYNDP 2024 projections for EU member states including the Czech Republic. A consistent trend is observed where conventional natural gas production diminishes to zero by mid-century (2050). By this timeframe—specifically in 2040 relative to National Trends+ baselines from 2030 levels—there will be a notable reduction of methane output, quantifying at approximately 31%. However, the DE and GA scenarios are set with more aggressive targets: reductions by 47% in Delivered Emissions (DE) scenario, compared to National Trends+ projections.

Diversified approaches toward indigenous renewable methane sources—encompassing biomethane and synthetic options through electrolysis technologies—are integral across these scenarios. The trajectory in the DE strategy particularly emphasizes a significant expansion of both types by 2050, facilitating an energy mix capable of offsetting traditional natural gas declines effectively.

Biomethane emerges as pivotal for decarbonizing our methane supply and is projected to fulfill the bulk share in this transformation process within deviation scenarios alike DE (920 TWh by 2050) and GA (635 TWh). The synthetic route, though less pronounced than biomethane's contribution, remains critical for bridging supply gaps towards a carbon-neutral horizon.

By the year of action inception—specifically at DE scenario benchmarking against 2040 levels or beyond into GA forecast outcomes (1078 TWh by 2050)—we observe an imminent cessation for methane imports, with synthetic and biomethane production meeting domestic demands.

This comprehensive approach to the Czech Republic's energy strategy within a global context reflects our commitment: transitioning towards sustainable decarbonized gas supplies while simultaneously ensuring economic resilience through diversification of renewables, as illustrated in Figure 32 and underpinned by rigorous scenario planning.
",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"The provided analysis underscores a pivotal shift in methane production across various scenarios, with an anticipated cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas output by 2050 as depicted in Figure 32 (refer to Energy Report for further details). By the year 2040 relative to National Trends+ baseline projections from 2030, methane production is expected to decline significantly—by approximately one-third. Deviation scenarios DE and GA propose more aggressive targets: a decrease of nearly half for both options by that same year (Energy Report).

In alignment with these trajectories, the role of indigenous renewable methane sources such as biomethane and synthetic variants produced via electrolysis becomes increasingly significant. The National Trends+ scenario illustrates a steady growth in bio-based methane output over time while limiting reliance on imports; concurrently, the production of artificial gas is projected to remain minimal (Energy Report). This dynamic ensures an adequate supply replacement for conventional natural gases.

Biogas emerges as a cornerstone in sustainable methane provision strategies within these scenarios—crucial not only for decarbonization but also for achieving carbon neutrality by the mid-21st century (Energy Report). By 2050, importer levels are projected to reach null across all models.

Focusing on specifics in energy distribution strategies like Distributed Energy reveals a nuanced landscape: while renewable and decarbonized methane generation stands at roughly 920 TWh by the mid-century mark, synthetic gas production surpasses that of biomethane (Energy Report). The scenario shows an appreciably lower reliance on imports compared to Global Ambition models.

Conversely, within a framework prioritizing EU integration in global energy transitions—Global Ambition scenarios advocate for high levels of decarbonization coupled with diversified and extensive accessibility to renewable methane markets (Energy Report). Implementation of stringent efficiency measures further contributes to the reduction of necessary imports, setting a trajectory toward complete elimination by 2050.

4,4.5,4.5.1,Germany,"In this Energy Report section, we examine methane dynamics within TYNDP (Technology-Neutral Decarbonisation Pathways) scenarios for EU27 member states with a particular focus on Germany's integration into global decarbonization efforts. Figure 32 illustrates the anticipated shifts in indigenous and imported methane across various projected timelines, notably reaching zero conventional natural gas production by mid-century (circa 2050).

Under scrutiny are three TYNDP scenarios—DE for Deep Emission Reductions, GA representing Global Ambition towards carbon neutrality, and Distributed Energy. By the year 2040 compared to National Trends+ projections from 2030, we witness a significant decline in methane production by approximately one-third (a reduction of around 31%). The DE scenario takes this further with ambitious cuts totaling near half (-47%), while GA proposes substantial reductions at about 40%.

The scenarios diverge when considering renewable sources. Biomethane emerges as a cornerstone for methane decarbonization, anticipated to dominate both DE and GA narratives by serving primarily in lieu of conventional natural gas supplies that are phased out entirely come 2050. Synthetic production via electrolysis complements biomethane but is less pronounced initially due to technological constraints; however, its significance amplifies as we progress towards carbon-neutral goals by mid-century—projected at around 285 TWh in the DE scenario and marginally higher within GA.

Focusing on Germany's role, Distributed Energy scenarios depict a nuanced decrease of indigenous renewable methane production to approximately 920 terawatt-hours (TWh) by mid-century—a reduction in overall supply that is offset through the strategic balance between biomethane and synthetic sources. Notably, Germany's Distributed Energy scenario envisions a near cessation of natural gas imports come 2050; this aligns with an overarching trend toward self-sufficiency in renewable methane generation that is characteristic across all scenarios analyzed herein.",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"In Figure 32, we present an analysis of methane supplies across various TYNDP 2024 scenarios with a unified decline trajectory for conventional indigenous natural gas production culminating in zero by 2050. Notably, the National Trends+ scenario predicts a significant contraction—31% below its baseline year of 2030 levels come 2040. In contrast, DE and GA scenarios pursue more aggressive reductions at rates surpassing this figure: approximately 47% for the former and nearly half that amount (~40%) for the latter scenario.

These figures underscore a shifting landscape in methane production where indigenous renewable sources, such as biomethane and synthetic variants produced via electrolysis processes, are gaining importance within each narrative framework of these scenarios. The National Trends+ model anticipates an escalation in the deployment of bio-based fuels over time while maintaining a modest outlook on electricity derived methane production due to current technological limitations and investment scales required for large scale electrolysis operations.

Biomethane emerges as pivotal within these narratives, acting predominantly in the decarbonization of existing supply mechanisms—it is highlighted across both deviation scenarios where it serves primarily this transformative role rather than a substantial portion representing overall methane output by 2050. Synthetic pathways to sustainable gas production are recognized as critical complements, essential for achieving the EU's carbon-neutral aspirations within these outlined timelines.

A zero import threshold is set forth in both scenarios with respect to methane by 2050—a testament to their long-term strategies aimed at self-sufficiency and reduced reliance on fossil fuel imports, which reflects a broader commitment toward achieving sustainable energy autonomy.

Delving into the Distributed Energy scenario reveals diminished indigenous contributions of renewables within its methane supply matrix—anticipated at 920 TWh by mid-century (2050). Despite this, synthetic gas production is projected to be marginally more robust than in"
4,4.5,4.5.1,Denmark,"Denmark's methane landscape is projected to transform significantly by mid-century, as delineated in Figure 32 of this energy report. Reflecting on three scenarios underpinning TYNDP 2024—Distributed Energy (DE), Global Ambition (GA), and National Trends+ with a focus up until the year 2050—a uniform trend emerges: conventional indigenous natural gas production is anticipated to cease completely by this milestone.

By 2040, an ambitious reduction trajectory becomes evident; compared to levels projected in National Trends+ for that same year, DE and GA scenarios reveal a substantial decrease of approximately one-third (31%) or more than half—respectively reaching around forty percent reductions. This pivot towards renewable sources is underscored by varying contributions from biomethane production across the board in accordance with each scenario's storyline, while synthetic methane generation through electrolysis remains limited yet significant under National Trends+ and expands notably within GA scenarios to fulfill supply needs.

The role of renewable gases—predominantly biomethane but also including substantial quantities from synthetic sources by 2050—becomes pivotal in offsetting the decline in conventional natural gas, thereby supporting Denmark's transition towards carbon neutrality and aligning with broader decarbonization efforts.

Focusing specifically on DE scenario outcomes for Denmark indicates a moderate indigenous production of renewable methane—estimated at 920 TWh by the year 2050, where biomethane accounts for around six hundred thirty-five thousand GWh. This figure underscores its critical contribution to meeting decarbonization targets despite a lower overall emphasis compared with scenarios like Global Ambition and National Trends+ which exhibit greater reliance on renewable imports as well as synthetic methane production—reaching upwards of 1078 TWh by the same date for GA scenario.

The DE narrative further articulates Denmark's commitment to energy self-sufficiency, with projected natural gas import levels dwindling progressively towards zero imports in alignment with international",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"The analysis of methane supplies across various scenarios within TYNDP (Technology, Policy and Deployment) framework reveals a consistent trend towards decarbonization by mid-century targets set for Denmark's energy sector: conventional natural gas production is projected to cease entirely in 2050. By the year 2040, there will be approximately a 31% reduction compared with baseline National Trends+ levels of methane output—with more aggressive reductions anticipated at 47% under DE and GA scenarios through enhanced biomethane production along with synthetic alternatives.

As the pivot towards renewable sources becomes increasingly pronounced, Denmark's strategy emphasizes significant growth in indigenous methane forms: particularly notable is an upsurge in bio-derived (biomethane) and advanced technological solutions such as electrochemically produced synthetic gases. These developments aim to adequately counterbalance the diminishing yields of traditional natural gas reserves, aligning with both national decarbonization goals and broader EU objectives for sustainable energy transitions by 2050—when methane imports are projected at nil in all scenarios.

In Denmark's Distributed Energy scenario (DE), we observe a strategic shift towards localized, renewably-derived methane sources with an estimated output of nearly 920 TWh by the year 2050—a figure that underscores reliance on indigenous production while also incorporating synthetic alternatives. The role for biomethane remains pivotal yet distinct, contributing about half to Denmark's renewable methane mix in this context and signifying a marked departure from conventional sources by 2050.

Conversely, the Global Ambition scenario (GA) illustrates an integrated approach that not only meets stringent domestic decarbonization standards but also positions Denmark within expansive global renewable markets for methane—anticipating a robust total of approximately 1078 TWh by mid-century. Here, the emphasis on energy efficiency measures is key to reducing reliance and eventual elimination (to zero) of natural gas imports as Denmark advances towards its am"
4,4.5,4.5.1,Estonia,"In alignment with TYNDP 2024 projections, Figure 32 delineates methane supply dynamics across varying scenarios for EU member states including Estonia. By mid-century (2050), all considered pathways converge on a cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production due to declining reserves and sustainability imperatives. Specifically, by 2040 there is an anticipated reduction in methane output—by roughly one third relative to the National Trends+ benchmark established for 2030 levels; with more aggressive reductions charted at approximately forty-seven percent (DE scenario) and thirty-nine percent (GA scenario).

The role of indigenous renewable methane sources—primarily biomethane, alongside synthetic alternatives produced via electrolysis processes—varies according to the specific narrative each scenario follows. Under National Trends+ projections, there is a gradual augmentation in biomethane output over time; however, it remains outpaced by potential growth from syn-tech methane production which plays an increasing role as Europe progresses toward its 2050 carbon neutrality objective.

Biomethane emerges not merely as a renewable substitute but stands at the forefront of efforts to decarbonize existing natural gas infrastructure within both deviation scenarios, underscoring it as Estonia's pivotal transition strategy for methane supply security and sustainability objectives. Synthetic pathways are poised not only complementary in nature—mitigating potential shortfalls of renewable sources by 2050 where imports reach nullity across all scenarios but also instrumental to achieving the overarching goal set for a carbon-neutral methane economy within this timeframe.

The Distributed Energy scenario posits reduced indigenous production levels—estimated at about nine hundred twenty terawatt hours (TWh) by 2050; with synthetic outputs slightly outperforming the Global Ambition plan, reaching approximately two hundred eighty-five TWh in that same year. Biomethane's contribution is substantial yet positioned as secondary to these developments within Estonia’s energy landscape for this scenario—reaching an estimated six hundred thirty-five",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"In Figure 32, we observe a comprehensive projection of methane supplies across three distinct scenarios within TYNDP 2024 frameworks—all anticipating an eventual cessation in conventional indigenous natural gas production by the year 2050. By this pivotal point, there is expected to be a marked contraction; specifically, methane output will have diminished by approximately one-third relative to levels documented under National Trends+ for 2030—with deviation scenarios DE and GA setting forth more stringent targets of reductions at 47% and 40%, respectively.

The spectrums in renewable methane production, encompassing both biomethane and synthetic variants derived via electrolysis technologies, are closely tied to the narratives prescribed by each scenario. Under National Trends+ projections, we witness a steady upswing of biomethane output over time; however, it's important to note that contributions from synthetic methane remain relatively modest in comparison.

These renewable gases collectively serve as an adequate buffer against the decline associated with conventional natural gas reserves and are integral for achieving decarbonization milestones within both deviation scenarios, underscoring biomethane's pivotal role while also highlighting synthetic methane’s contribution towards a net-zero emissions target by 2050.

Advancing to Estonia and its position in the broader context of EU energy dynamics requires an examination through scenarios such as Distributed Energy—which signals reduced indigenous renewable outputs, quantified at around 920 TWh for that year; conversely, synthetic methane is projected slightly higher than within Global Ambition. Here biomethane emerges with significant influence yet a more subdued profile in the overall mix—accounting to about 635 TWh by mid-century (2041).

In terms of import dynamics, Distributed Energy scenarios portend minimal natural gas imports as early as 2040 and an eventual total nullity by 2050. On the other hand, Global Ambition charts a course for robust decarbonization efforts complemented with strategic energy efficiency intervent"

*Figure Reference: Methane supply dynamics as outlined in Figure [insert number]*   

The triad of scenarios within the Third Technology Package 2045 (TYNDP3.2) forecasts a significant reduction trajectory for conventional indigenous natural gas production, culminating at zero by mid-century—specifically targeted to align with Spain's commitment under its National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP). By the year 2040, there will be an approximate contraction of methane output by 31%, contrasting starkly against baseline projections set in NECP+ for that decade. To illustrate further ambition within these frameworks: Scenario DE anticipates a more aggressive reduction rate at around 47%, while the GA scenario forecasts an even steeper decline of roughly 40%.

In concert with traditional gas sources, there is considerable variability in indigenous renewable methane production—biomethane and synthetic variants being chief contributors. Notably, Spain's National Trends+ (NT+) scenario projects a gradual uptick of biomethane outputs over time while constraining the role that electrolytic-derived synthetic gas plays within its energy matrix due to current technological and economic barriers.

The strategic pivot towards renewable gases is pivotal for compensating declines in conventional natural sources, with biomethane emerging as a linchpin element driving the decarbonization of Spain's methane supply chain—an essential factor across both deviation scenarios delineated within TYNDP3.2 frameworks.

By 2050 under these projections, net imports are poised to reach nullity in all three outlined pathways; however, the Distributed Energy (DE) scenario demonstrates a more modest indigenous renewable gas production—hovering around 920 TWh by mid-century. The Global Ambition (GA) scenario surpasses this with an estimated output of approximately 1,078 TWh in similar timeframe and reflects greater reliance on international mark",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"In Figure 32, we observe a comprehensive analysis of methane supplies across various scenarios within TYNDP 2024's framework for European energy strategy. Predictions indicate that by mid-century (2050), traditional natural gas production will cease entirely in all models—a stark contrast to the baseline scenario, which sees a significant decrease of up to 31% from National Trends+ benchmark levels by 2040. In particular, DE and GA scenarios showcase more aggressive declines at rates of approximately 47% and 40%, respectively—a testament to our commitment towards ambitious decarbonization targets.

Within these frameworks lies a diversified production landscape for indigenous renewable methane sources, including biomethane (produced from organic waste) and synthetic alternatives generated by electrolysis processes—a key component in our transition to sustainability. The cumulative output of such green gases is designed not only to offset conventional natural gas shortfalls but also ensure a robust supply chain for future energy demands, reflecting the strategies employed across all scenarios.

The pivotal role biomethane plays as an indispensable renewable resource cannot be overstated; it underpins our decarbonization efforts within these projections and is projected to serve as a primary source of methane for both deviation pathways by 2050. Synthetic methane, although playing secondary supportive roles in supply sustenance towards carbon neutrality targets set for the same year, remains integral due to its potential scalability with advancing technology and infrastructure deployment strategies.

By this juncture of our analysis—and looking ahead through 2050—import reliances on methane are anticipated to reach null values across all scenarios as a part of the broader energy transition narrative, signaling self-sufficiency in renewable gas production within Europe. Notably, Spain's participation and strategy align with these projections:

In examining specific regional contributions like that of Spain under TYNDP 2024 scenarios—such as Distributed Energy (DE) or Global Ambition (GA), it is evident they will experience distinct trajectories in renewable methane"
4,4.5,4.5.1,Finland,"In examining Figure 32, we observe a comprehensive projection of methane supplies under three distinct TYNDP 2024 scenarios—namely National Trends+ (NT), Distributed Energy (DE), and Global Ambition (GA). A pivotal trend across these projections is the anticipated cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production by the year 2050. By this juncture, a significant contraction in methane output manifests: National Trends+ predicts a decrease to levels observed at NT's baseline for 2040; DE forecasts an even steeper decline with reductions of up to 47%, while GA envisages similar cutbacks.

As conventional sources dwindle, the emphasis shifts towards indigenous renewable methane production—biomethane and synthetic variants through electrolytic processes are projected in varying capacities across scenarios according to their unique narratives. The NT scenario anticipates an escalation of biomethane output over time, albeit with a limited contribution from synthetically produced methane via electrolysis—an approach that aligns renewable gas production sufficiently to offset the conventional decline by 2050's deadline.

Biomethane emerges as an integral component in achieving sustainability targets, serving predominantly within DE and GA scenarios for decarbonizing methane supplies. The role of synthetic methane becomes increasingly crucial under these ambitious paths to achieve carbon neutrality by the mid-century mark.

Notably, all three pathways converge on a common endpoint: complete elimination of import levels and natural gas dependency come 2050—a testament to self-reliance in methane sourcing through renewable means within Finland's energy matrix as depicted by Figure 32.

In the DE scenario, indigenous production reaches a peak at approximately 920 TWh for 2050 with synthetic inputs slightly overshadowing biomethane contributions—reflective of its lower overall significance compared to NT's trajectory but vital within this contextual framework. By contrast, the Global Ambition scenario positions Finland as an energy",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"The methane landscape within Finnish policy frameworks, as illustrated in Figure 32 of our report, reflects a strategic transition towards sustainability by 2050. In all considered scenarios under TYNDP 2024 projections—namely Distributed Energy (DE), Global Ambition (GA), and National Trends+ (NT+)—there is an anticipated cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production, culminating in zero by the mid-century mark.

By analyzing trends leading up to 2040, we observe a significant decline; specifically, methane output under NT+ scenario experiences a notable reduction by approximately one third compared with its levels projected for National Trends+ 2030—a contrast of stark significance when juxtaposed against DE and GA scenarios which pursue more aggressive cutbacks at rates of 47% in the former and around half that figure, or a conservative reduction by approximately one-fifth with NT+.

The pivot towards indigenous renewable methane sources—comprising biomethane alongside synthetic variants derived from electrolytic processes—varies congruently across these scenarios in accordance to their distinct narratives. In the National Trends+'s prognostication, we witness a trajectory of augmented production for both types; however, it's within DE and GA where synthetic methane emerges as an increasingly pivotal element aiming towards full carbon neutrality by 2050.

The Finnish energy matrix is set to achieve zero import levels concerning natural gas well in advance of the anticipated timeline, underscored across all scenarios with a clear commitment toward sustainable decarbonization practices—a testament to Finland's proactive stance within its national and global environmental stewardship.

Focusing on DE scenario specificity reveals lower indigenous renewable methane production, estimated at 920 TWh by the year of reference; yet it is synthetic contributions which slightly outstrip their GA counterparts—hovering around a substantial figure nearing three quarters (approximately 285 TWh) in that same time frame. Biomethane's role"
4,4.5,4.5.1,France,"In our analysis of methane dynamics within French energy policy, Figure 32 delineates projections across various scenarios under TYNDP 2024 frameworks. By mid-century (2050), a cessation in conventional indigenous natural gas production is anticipated, with all scenarios projecting complete decline by this benchmark year.

By the decade of the '30s—specifically 2040 compared to National Trends+ projections from 2030 levels—there will be a substantial reduction in methane output; we observe decreases ranging between 31% and as high as 47%, depending on whether one examines the DE or GA scenarios.

The diversification of indigenous renewable sources such as biomethane is central to these projections, with varying extents detailed according to each scenario's narrative. Notably under National Trends+ forecasts are rising trends in sustainable methane generation and a modest contribution from synthetic production via electrolytic methods—signifying the potential for renewable gases to fully offset conventional gas declines by 2050.

Biomethane emerges as an indispensable component, centralizing its role in de-carbonization strategies within both deviation scenarios and serving as a principal decarbonizer of methane supplies across the board for France's energy future—by zeroing out import levels by 2050.

Synthetic alternatives complement biomethane, with their output projected to scale upwards significantly; they are pivotal in achieving carbon neutrality within our ambitious timelines and targets set forth for the year of cessation—no imports expected beyond this period under both DE and GA scenarios.

Specifically examining France's Distributed Energy scenario, we project a diminished level (920 TWh in 2050) when contrasted with global ambitions; synthetic methane production is marginally higher here than within the Global Ambition framework but falls short of biomethane contribution—approximately accounting for around half that figure. By this same year, Distributed Energy's import needs are minimal and forecasted to be non-existent by 20",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"In Figure 32, we observe a comprehensive analysis of methane resource availability across various TYNDP 2024 scenarios for an informed policy framework aimed at energy stakeholders and decision-makers in France. By the year 2050, there is envisioned to be zero conventional indigenous natural gas production within these models – a milestone reflecting significant progress towards sustainable practices.

As we approach midpoint benchmarks like 2040, notable reductions are projected: specifically, National Trends+ scenario indicates an approximately 31% decline in methane output compared to baseline projections for that year – a stepping stone toward achieving more aggressive targets. Herein lies the distinction among scenarios; DE and GA showcase greater ambition with reductions of up to 47% (DE) and nearly half at about 40% in synthetic methane production, respectively—a testament to their innovative strategies towards decarbonization goals.

The role that renewable forms such as biomethane play cannot be understated; they become increasingly pivotal within these scenarios for the transition toward carbon neutrality by mid-century – a cornerstone of our national energy narratives, especially when considering their substantial contribution to decarbonizing methane supplies.

Synthetic methane emerges as another key player in this evolutionary shift; its production is not merely supplemental but instrumental for addressing supply deficits and ensuring carbon neutrality by 2050 – a critical juncture that our nation must navigate with vigilance.

Reflective of the scenario-specific outcomes, import levels are set to reach nullification in both deviation scenarios; this underscores an anticipated self-sufficiency and reduced dependency on external energy sources by 2050 – a vision shared across our strategic forecasts for France's future.

The Distributed Energy scenario presents nuanced challenges with its lower indigenous production of renewable, decarbonized methane projected at roughly 920 TWh in the year ahead; however, it is juxtaposed against a slightly higher synthetic output and significant yet smaller role for biomethane—appro"
4,4.5,4.5.1,Greece,"The forthcoming analysis delineates methane availability across three distinct scenarios within TYNDP 2024, reflecting a unified trajectory toward complete cessation of traditional indigenous natural gas by mid-century (2050). Notably, the year 2040 marks an anticipated reduction in methane output by approximately one third relative to projected levels under National Trends+ foresight. The DE and GA scenarios diverge further with ambitious targets: a notable contraction of nearly half (47%) within the Developer Energy framework, while Global Ambition aspires towards an even more substantial 40% diminution in methane production from conventional sources by this same benchmark year.

In alignment with these scenarios' narratives is the variable contribution to overall renewable gas output; notably biomethane and synthetic forms such as electrolytic generation emerge prominently within each context, demonstrating a nuanced landscape of methane decarbonization strategies tailored for Greece.

Biomethane stands out as an indispensable element in the arsenal against emissions, serving as both principal agent and foundation upon which renewed energy paradigms are constructed within these scenarios—DE and GA alike aim to nullify methane import reliance by 2050. Meanwhile, synthetic production is envisaged not merely supplementary but integral in achieving a net-zero carbon footprint for the nation's future energy matrix through this transformative epoch.

Scenario specificity reveals variegated landscape dynamics—the Distributed Energy model forecasts diminished indigenous renewable and decarbonized methane production, constricting to 920 TWh by mid-century (circa 2050), with synthetic variants marginally exceeding their Global Ambition counterparts. Biomethane's role remains critical yet less pronounced within this framework as it accounts for a significant portion of the total renewable methane yield, estimated at roughly two thirds by year-end evaluation in 2050. The narrative underscores an absence of natural gas imports well into the future under Distributed Energy's purview—an assertion corroborated with minimal reliance on",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"The methane landscape within TYNDP 2024 scenarios illustrates a concerted shift towards decarbonization, with conventional natural gas production projected to cease by 2050 across all models considered. Specifically, there is an anticipated reduction of approximately 31% in traditional methane output relative to the National Trends+ benchmark for 2040—a figure that underscores a more ambitious target set at around 47% and 40%, respectively, within Deviation (DE) and Global Ambition scenarios.

Diversification of renewable methane sources emerges as pivotal; biomethane production is poised to expand congruently with the strategic objectives laid out in each scenario narrative. Notably, synthetic methane via electrolysis sees limited deployment under National Trends+ but gains prominence within scenarios aiming for deeper decarbonization efforts—synthetically supporting supply sufficiency as conventional reserves dwindle to zero by the mid-century target date.

With biomethane identified as a critical agent in driving methane sector transformation, it emerges predominantly responsible for sustaining decreasing import levels within both DE and Global Ambition contexts—achieving net neutrality well ahead of 2050 timelines. In contrast to this approachable trend is the Distributed Energy scenario's lower indigenous renewable methane output, projected at roughly 920 TWh for that same year under review and a diminished reliance on imports by virtue of its strategic energy framework.

The Global Ambition narrative advances an integrated vision—embracing robust decarbonization coupled with the promise of global trade in renewable methane, anticipating consumption figures scaling to approximately 1078 TWh come 2050 through a prismatic lens focusing on energy efficiency gains. This scenario boldly forecasts an eradication of natural gas imports by that same year while maintaining the momentum towards carbon-neutral ambitions for methane supply chains within Greece, as depicted in Figure 32's comprehensive portrayal against a backdrop of EU energy evolution strategies.

In summation, these scenarios"
4,4.5,4.5.1,Croatia,"In assessing future methane supplies within all three TYNDP (Technology, Economy and Society) scenarios for 2050, it is evident that conventional indigenous natural gas production will cease entirely by this year's end. By the midpoint of our projection period at 2040, there has been a notable reduction in methane output—by approximately one-third compared to levels forecasted under National Trends+ for 2030 baseline conditions. However, more ambitious targets are set by DE (Distributed Energy) and GA (Global Ambition) scenarios with reductions of up to 47% in the former scenario and around a quarter less than that figure within GA's framework respectively.

The landscape for indigenous renewable methane, encompassing biomethane as well as synthetic variants derived from electrolytic processes, is subject to variation across these scenarios based on their individualized storylines and objectives. Notably under the National Trends+ scenario, a steady growth trajectory for biomethane production can be observed while there remains an anticipated modest contribution of renewable synthetic methane through electrolysis by 2050's endgame—a component crucial in offsetting conventional natural gas decline.

Biomethane emerges as a pivotal agent for the decarbonization initiative within our current energy matrix, predominantly driving down emissions across both deviation scenarios alike. Concurrently, synthetic methane is posited to be instrumental in supplementing supply and achieving carbon neutrality goals by 2050—a testament to its integral role alongside biomethane within the decarbonization strategy.

Regarding import levels of renewable gases, a trajectory toward nullification has been charted for both DE and GA scenarios as we approach mid-century milestones; this represents an ambitious stride towards self-sufficiency in methane supply chains within the EU27 context.

Focusing on specifics, under Distributed Energy scenario parameters—which prioritize localized energy solutions and integration into broader regional grids—indigenous production of renewable decarbonised sources is projected to",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"The provided data illustrates methane production dynamics under various scenarios, as depicted in Figure 32 within our Energy Report for policy makers and stakeholders from TSOs to NGOs with a focus on nuclear energy progression. Each scenario projects zero conventional indigenous natural gas output by the year 2050—a significant milestone toward sustainability goals.

By mid-century, there is anticipated reduction in methane production: National Trends+ shows an overall decline of 31%, with DE and GA scenarios projecting more aggressive reductions at 47% and 40%, respectively—indicating a progressively ambitious approach to decarbonization.

Renewable methane sources, including biomethane and synthetic varieties produced through electrolysis technology (synthetic via hydrogen), are expected to scale up according to scenario-specific narratives by 2050. These renewables aim not only at offsetting the decline in traditional natural gas but also enhancing energy security within a carbon neutral framework, thereby contributing significantly toward achieving decarbonization targets across all scenarios.

Particularly emphasizing biomethane's role—it is central to methane supply sustainability and will drive the majority of reduction efforts in both deviation pathways by 2050 when imports are slated for complete cessation, thus underscoring its indispensable position within our decarbonization strategy.

In scenarios like Distributed Energy (DE), although renewable methane generation is lower at an estimated 920 TWh in the year 2050 with synthetic alternatives slightly leading and biomethane contributing to a substantial proportion of that figure, there remains minimal reliance on imports by this time. This aligns with our global energy transition ambitions as we edge closer toward zero natural gas dependence.

Contrastingly, the Global Ambition scenario posits an integrated EU engagement in worldwide renewable and decarbonized methane markets reaching a capacity of 1078 TWh by mid-century—a reflection of our commitment to both high environmental standards and energy market diversification. Concurrently, through stringent efficiency improvements, the reliance"
4,4.5,4.5.1,Hungary,"In Figure 32, we observe a comprehensive examination of methane availability across three distinct scenarios within TYNDP 2024: National Trends+ (NT), Deviation Scenario DE, and Global Ambition GA by the year 2050. Each scenario projects an alignment with ambitious targets for conventional indigenous natural gas production reduction to zero over time. By this metric, a significant downscaling is projected—a decrease of approximately 31% compared to NT's baseline level in DE by the year 2040 and more pronounced reductions at roughly 47% for DE while GA anticipates around 40%.

As we pivot towards renewable methane, it is evident that both biomethane—a critical contributor to this decarbonised supply chain—and synthetic methane via electrolytic processes are integral. The trajectory for their production varies with scenario-specific narratives but collectively they offset the anticipated decline in traditional natural gas sources, maintaining a balanced energy portfolio.

In terms of biomethane's role within these scenarios—its contribution to renewable methane supply cannot be understated as it emerges not only pivotal for decarbonization efforts but also becomes the cornerstone in achieving carbon neutrality targets by mid-century, with zero imports projected.

The Distributed Energy scenario delineates a unique landscape: an anticipated 920 TWh of renewable and low-carbon methane production is forecasted for Hungary's market alone come the year 2050—with synthetic variants surpassing imports to reach approximately 285 TWh. Notably, biomethane accounts for a significant portion at about 635 TWh while maintaining minimal reliance on imported resources by that milestone date and projected zero import levels thereafter in both scenarios NT and DE.

The Global Ambition scenario encapsulates an aggressive approach to energy transition: amalgamating high decarbonization rates with strategic accessibility for renewable methane imports, reaching 1078 TWh by the year's end in a global context—a testament to its dual amb",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"In Figure 32, we delineate methane provision across various scenarios within TYNDP 2024 projections for EU member states such as Hungary. Each scenario presupposes a decline in indigenous natural gas production to cessation by the year 2050—a critical pivot point underscoring our collective energy transition ambitions. By mid-century, methane outputs are projected to dwindle by upwards of one-third relative to National Trends+ benchmarks set for 2030 in most scenarios; however, the DE and GA models chart a more aggressive course with reductions scaling at approximately 47% and 40%, respectively.

Renewable methane sources such as biomethane gain prominence within these strategic narratives—reflecting their pivotal role in the decarbonization journey, particularly under deviation scenarios where they serve predominantly to fill production gaps left by conventional fuels' phase-out. Synthetic routes via electrolysis emerge as complementary conduits towards a carbon-neutral horizon for methane supply chains.

By the year 2050, we anticipate an absolute cessation of both biomass and synthetically derived imports across all considered scenarios—a testament to our sustained commitment toward energy self-sufficiency within a decarbonized framework. In particular contexts like Distributed Energy models where indigenous renewable methane supply is comparatively curtailed, the role of biomethane ascends markedly (estimated at 635 TWh in that scenario), yet synthetic production offers an amplified contribution compared to Global Ambition scenarios—reaching approximately 285 TWh by mid-century.

The Distributed Energy model illustrates the lowest indigenous renewable and decarbonized methane provision at a projected volume of just under one thousand gigawatt hours (920 TWh) for Hungary in 2050, with no natural gas imports anticipated by that year. Meanwhile, Global Ambition scenarios underscore the dual advantages afforded through high decarbonization rates and strategic market positioning—capitalizing on renewable sources while decreasing m"
4,4.5,4.5.1,Ireland,"In accordance with projections detailed in Figure 32, all scenarios under TYNDP 2024 forecast a convergence towards zero conventional indigenous natural gas production by the year 2050 due to similar declines across various models. By this benchmark date—in particular for DE and GA scenarios which exceed baseline expectations with reductions of 47% and 40%, respectively, compared to National Trends+'s conservative estimate at a decrease rate of only 31% from current levels by mid-century (2040)—the landscape is poised for significant transformation.

The diversification strategy encompasses an augmented production capacity in indigenous renewable methane, namely biomethane and synthetic variants derived through electrolysis processes. This shift not only reflects the scenarios' commitment to sustainability but also ensures that by 2050, such innovations are anticipated as a reliable counterbalance against diminishing conventional gas supplies.

Biomethane emerges as an indispensable pillar in this transition towards renewables; its role is magnified within deviation scenarios where it stands out not only for volume but also due to the substantial decarbonization potentials attributed thereto, thereby serving both pivotal and complementary functions.

In alignment with carbon neutrality targets set by 2050, synthetic methane production assumes a critical operational role—anticipated as instrumental in surmounting supply gaps while simultaneously fostering the necessary decarbonization trajectory for both DE and GA scenarios to achieve their respective ambitions.

The strategic reduction of import dependencies is evidenced by projected zero levels, signifying an endgame wherein self-sufficiency becomes paramount—a hallmark feature in Distributed Energy scenario projections with 920 TWh indigenous renewable and decarbonized methane production juxtaposed against a synthetic contribution of approximately 635 TWh by the same year, all while maintaining minimal reliance on imports as early as 2040.

Conversely, Global Ambition scenario paints an expansive picture wherein robust decarbonization is achieved through ambitious energy efficiency initiatives and access",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"**Methane Supply Projections in TYNDP 2024 Scenarios and Their Implications for Policy Makers, Transmission System Operators (TSOs), Energy Project Owners, and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): An Overview of Ireland's Pathway to Carbon Neutrality**

Figure 32 delineates the trajectory of methane supply within TYNDP 2024 scenarios for Europe. By mid-century, conventional indigenous natural gas production is projected to cease entirely across all models by 2050 due to a consistent downward trend in output levels. Specifically:
   - The National Trends+ scenario anticipates an overall reduction of methane supplies from baseline projections (referenced as NT+30) by approximately 31% come the year 2040, with further ambitious targets set out for both Distribution Energy and Global Ambition scenarios at reductions exceeding this benchmark—by up to 47% in DE and a significant yet commensurate reduction of 40% within GA.
   - The emergent sectors such as biomethane (encompassing agricultural, organic waste-derived methane) alongside synthetic variants produced through electrolysis are poised to experience growth in line with the distinct objectives outlined for each scenario's energy landscape.
   - The National Trends+ model forecasts a notable enhancement of biomethane production, underscoring its pivotal role as an indispensable renewable methane contributor throughout this transition period and beyond—its share in the decarbonization strategy remains substantial for both DE and GA scenarios.
   - The synthetic pathway to achieving carbon neutrality is fortified by advancements made through electrolysis, highlighting its potential as a critical supplementary resource alongside biomethane production efforts aimed at fulfilling the methane supply gap until 2050.
   - The ambitious vision encapsulated within both scenarios is clear: to achieve net zero levels of imported natural gas by their respective mid-century milestones, thereby aligning with broader climate objectives and reducing reliance"
4,4.5,4.5.1,Italy,"In Figure 32, we observe a comprehensive examination of methane availability across three distinct scenarios within TYNDP 2024 projections: National Trends+ (National), Distributed Energy Integration (DEI), and Global Ambition for Renewables (GA). These models uniformly project the cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production by the year 2050, with a significant reduction already anticipated—a drop to three-quarters below present levels in National Trends+ by 2040.

The DEI scenario envisages an even more aggressive approach toward reducing methane emissions through increased indigenous renewable and decarbonised sources, including biomethane (accounting for approximately two-thirds of the total supply) as well as synthetic options generated via electrolysis. By contrast, GA scenario's emphasis lies heavily on harnessing international markets to achieve a robust 1078 TWh renewable and decarbonised methane output by midcentury—thanks in part also to enhanced energy efficiency measures that further curtail import reliance down from pre-2040 levels.

Italy's alignment with these scenarios reveals strategic shifts towards a sustainable future, wherein national production of renewables is poised for substantial growth and imports are projected as near null by 2050—a testament to the country’s commitment toward energy transition. This pivot not only addresses environmental concerns but also strengthens Italy's position within an increasingly interconnected global economy that values decarbonisation efforts aligned with international standards of sustainability and innovation in methane supply solutions.

By embracing these scenarios, policy makers are presented with a blueprint for navigating the energy transition effectively—a journey marked by significant investments into renewable technologies while maintaining reliability through strategic planning to ensure an uninterrupted energy flow that meets both domestic and international commitments towards carbon neutrality.

By mid-century in all examined pathways—typed as DE for Distributed Energy initiatives and GA representing Global Ambition trajectories, the conventional natural gas yield is projected towards extinction. Specifically:

By 2040's benchmark relative to National Trends+ projections of that era (excluding synthetic methane), a substantial decrease in indigenous production by approximately one-third ensues across all scenarios—with the DE scenario registering an even more pronounced reduction at nearly half.

The shift towards renewable and decarbonized sources is evident, particularly within biomethane outputs which experience growth over time under National Trends+ parameters; conversely, synthetic methane via electrolysis shows relatively modest development in this context. The cumulative impact of these green gas contributions adeptly offsets the dwindling natural reserves by 2050—a critical juncture for sustainable energy policies and infrastructure planning among Italy's policymakers, industry leaders (including project owners), environmental organizations, and international collaborators.

Biomethane emerges as a linchpin in the decarbonization of methane resources; its prominence is magnified within both DE and GA scenarios where it acts predominantly to achieve emission-neutrality goals by 2050—an objective underscored through strategic energy management.

In tandem with biomethane's ascendancy, synthetic methane assumes a complementary role; its production scale is notably higher in the DE scenario compared to GA (approximately 318 TWh against an anticipated value of around 267 TWh for this year).

The Distributed Energy vision delineates lower indigenous methane generation, quantified at about 920 terawatt-hours by the midpoint and peaking in importance within its synthetic counterpart (approximately 285 TWh), though biomethane remains substantial with nearly half of this figure.

4,4.5,4.5.1,Lithuania,"In Figure 32, we examine methane availability across various scenarios outlined in TYNDP 2024 for EU member states such as Lithuania by 2050. All projections converge on the cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production within this timeframe. Notably, there is an anticipated decline to a mere third (31%) in methane output relative to National Trends+ benchmarks set for 2040 by DE and GA scenarios—the former aiming at a more pronounced reduction of approximately 47%, while the latter targets around 40%.

The landscape of indigenous renewable sources, including biomethane and synthetic methane production, aligns with each scenario's strategic direction. The National Trends+ pathway indicates an upward trend in bio-based gas contributions over time coupled with a modest initiation into electrolytically derived synfuels—enough to offset the dip from traditional sources and maintain overall supply equilibrium.

Biomethane emerges as a cornerstone for methane decarbonization strategies, offering substantial reductions in emissions under both deviation scenarios by 2050 where imports are projected at zero levels. Concurrently, synthetic pathways to synfuels gain prominence and must expand significantly—the linchpin toward achieving carbon-neutrality benchmarks set for mid-century milestones.

Focusing on Lithuania under the Distributed Energy scenario reveals a modest 920 TWh of indigenous renewable methane in supply by 2050, with synthetic contributions slightly outpacing those projected within Global Ambition frameworks—reaching approximately 285 TWh. Biomethane's contribution remains substantial at around 635 TWh but is secondary to its counterparts under the same scenario framework as imports are expected not only minimal by comparison in year-end projections for all scenarios, yet zero when considering natural gas contributions post-2049 onwards.

The Global Ambition approach champions an integrated vision of EU participation within a wider international methane transition narrative—projecting high decarbonization rates and diversified renewable sourcing strategies which",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"In Figure 32, we examine methane provision across three TYNDP 2024 projections to illustrate a pivotal shift towards sustainability in energy policy for Lithuania's stakeholders—policy makers and industry leaders. By the year 2050, conventional natural gas production is projected to cease entirely across all scenarios. Specifically by this milestone date, there will be an approximately 31% decrease from current levels as per National Trends+ projections; DE scenario forecasts a more substantial reduction of up to 47%, while the GA model anticipates a significant dip at around 40%.

The landscape for indigenous renewable methane, encompassing biomethane and synthetic forms produced via electrolysis technology, varies in alignment with each scenario's trajectory. Under National Trends+ projections, there is a gradual escalation of biomethane production coupled with limited but strategic deployment of synthetic methane to support decarbonization initiatives and meet the growing demand for renewable gas sources by 2050—when imports are expected to reach zero.

Biomethane emerges as an indispensable asset in Lithuania's energy transition, underpinning a substantial portion of methane decarbonization efforts within both deviation scenarios and playing a pivotal role when juxtaposed with synthetic alternatives that promise to bridge supply gaps towards carbon neutrality by mid-century.

Furthermore, the Distributed Energy scenario delineates lower indigenous production of renewable methane (920 TWh in 2050), a notable reduction compared to Global Ambition scenarios which forecast an increased reliance on synthetic sources—nearly reaching 285 TWh by mid-century. Biomethane, while crucial within this context, remains secondary relative to its importance under the other outlined models but still accounts for about half of Lithuania's renewable methane mix in anticipated future energy portfolios (approximately 635 TWh by 2050).

4,4.5,4.5.1,Luxembourg,"The methane landscape within all three TYNDP 2024 scenarios is depicted in Figure 32, illustrating a consistent trend toward eliminating conventional indigenous natural gas production by mid-century (target of zero emissions in 2050). By the year 2040, there's an anticipated reduction of methane output compared to baseline projections under National Trends+ for 2030 – a decline ranging from 31% to substantially higher ambitions between scenarios DE (47%) and GA (40%).

The evolution in renewable sources, including biomethane production alongside synthetic methane via electrochemical processes such as electolyser technology, aligns with the strategic objectives of each scenario. By 2050, these alternative energy vectors are poised to fully offset conventional natural gas declines and contribute significantly toward a zero-carbon future for Luxembourg's methane supply chain.

Biomethane stands out as an indispensable element in the decarbonization narrative of Europe’s methane sector, underpinning both deviation scenarios with its sustainability credentials and volume potential – estimated to reach 635 TWh by mid-century within Distributed Energy scenario projections. Meanwhile, synthetic pathways are projected as complementary solutions essential for achieving carbon neutrality goals well before the century's end.

In an era where energy imports play a diminishing role in national strategies – underscoring Luxembourg’s commitment to self-reliance and sustainability within its methane supply framework, Distributed Energy scenarios are characterized by reduced indigenous renewable production (920 TWh expected for 2050). Notwithstanding this limitation in local generation capacity, synthetic sources surpass biomethane output with a projected yield of approximately 285 TWh. The strategic pivot towards energy independence is further exemplified by the complete phase-out of natural gas imports anticipated to culminate at zero emissions across both scenarios within this timeframe.

Global Ambition, Luxembourg's scenario that harmonizes robust decarbonization with a commitment to global market integration for renewables and synthetic methane solutions",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"In evaluating methane production under various scenarios outlined in TYNDP 2024, a consistent reduction of conventional natural gas output is projected to reach zero by mid-century (Figure 32). By this timeframe—specifically the year 2050—a substantial shift towards renewable sources becomes evident. In comparison with baseline projections for National Trends+ in 2040, there's a pronounced decline of up to 61% across all scenarios when considering indigenous methane production alone (National Trends+'37%, DE scenario 's reduction at approximately 58.5%).

Notably divergent ambitions are apparent in the Distributed Energy and Global Ambition frameworks, with synthetic gas generation playing a pivotal role towards achieving carbon neutrality goals by year's end of this century (2050). Biomethane emerges as an indispensable component for methane supply decarbonization in both scenarios.

In the Distributed Energy scenario, renewables such as biomethane contribute significantly—anticipated at roughly 635 TWh by mid-century (2050). However, synthetic gas production is slightly more pronounced here than within Global Ambition's framework and compensates for a lower indigenous output. The latter scenario depicts robust decarbonization strategies with an impressive renewable methane mix projected to total 1078 TWh in the same year, alongside markedly reduced dependency on imports (downscaled to nil by mid-century).

Luxembourg's position within these scenarios reflects its commitment towards sustainable energy transitions. The country is poised for significant growth and transformation with a clear focus on renewables—biomethane, synthetic methane included—to achieve an environmentally conscious yet economically feasible future (Figure 32).

The projections reveal a universal trend towards the cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production, reaching zero output in this period across all three pathways—a testament to our collective commitment toward reducing carbon emissions. By 2040, relative reductions are stark; National Trends+ shows an anticipated decrease by approximately one-third compared with the baseline year of 2030 for methane production levels. The Distributed Energy Integration and Global Ambition scenarios further intensify their commitment to decarbonization—47% in DE, while GA scenario exhibits a noteworthy reduction rate at 40%.

Renewable sources of methane gain prominence within these forecasts. Biomethane emerges as the predominant renewable contributor to Latvia's energy matrix by 2050, underscored in both deviation scenarios for its substantial decarbonization impact on our national gas supply chain—a cornerstone of environmental stewardship and economic resilience.

Synthetic methane also occupies a pivotal position; particularly within the Global Ambition scenario where it is envisaged to significantly bolster energy diversity, thereby underpinning Latvia's pursuit toward carbon neutrality by 2050—a hallmark of our global responsibilities.

To encapsulate: Imports are projected at null levels in the year ahead for all scenarios as we strive to fulfill these ambitious decarbonization targets, a milestone that marks Latvia's dedication and progressive energy policy evolution within Europe’s wider nuclear development framework. Figure 32 encapsulates this visionary methane supply blueprint poised for the EU Member States including Latvia—a cornerstone in our quest toward sustainable, diversified renewable sources of clean fuel by mid-century milestones.

(Note: The fictional """,Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"In Figure 32, we delineate a comprehensive analysis of methane availability across three distinct scenarios within TYNDP 2024 frameworks: National Trends+ (National), Distributed Energy (DE) and Global Ambition (GA). Each scenario projects the cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production by mid-century, specifically reaching zero in 2050.
By this milestone year—contrasting with levels recorded under the National Trends+ baseline set for 2030—methane outputs are anticipated to plummet by approximately one third (a reduction of roughly 31%) within DE and GA scenarios, whereas a more pronounced cutback is projected at nearly half in both DE and GA.
The diversification strategy includes the augmentation of indigenous renewable methane sources such as biomethane alongside synthetic production through electrolysis processes by 2050—each playing an integral part within their respective narrative constructs for sustainability objectives. Notably, National Trends+ forecasts a progressive escalation in the generation of biomethane over time while limiting its reliance on synthetic methane production through electrolysis due to current technological constraints and economic considerations.
Biomethane emerges as an indispensable player within our decarbonization strategy, particularly for mitigating the decline in conventional natural gas supplies; it is projected that its contribution will be pivotal across both deviation scenarios toward achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. In parallel, synthetic methane production assumes a complementary role to satisfy energy demands and propel us towards our zero-emission goals within the same timeframe.
Within these frameworks, net import levels are projected at null for both scenarios in alignment with long-term sustainability targets; however, by 2050 we will achieve this through a combination of enhanced indigenous renewable and decarbonized methane production capabilities alongside strategic international partnerships.

4,4.5,4.5.1,Malta,"The methane landscape within all three TYNDP 2024 scenarios projects a significant shift towards zero conventional indigenous natural gas production by the year 2050, with notable reductions already anticipated; for instance, there's an expected decrease of up to 31% compared to baseline levels in National Trends+ scenario. Notably, both Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios underscore a progressive decline but differ substantially: DE targets approximately 47%, while GA envisions around 40%.

Renewable sources such as biomethane are set to rise in prominence within these frameworks. In National Trends+, there is an anticipated gradual increase over time with synthetic methane production remaining relatively modest due to limited electrolysis capacity; however, the collective output of renewables serves adequately for bridging gaps left by conventional gas decline and paving a path towards sustainability.

Biomethane emerges as an indispensable player in this transition phase—the linchpin enabling major strides toward decarbonizing the methane supply, particularly within deviation scenarios where it is poised to lead efforts for zero-emissions targets by 2050. Synthetic alternatives complement biomethane's role and are pivotal in achieving carbon neutrality objectives on schedule.

Imports of natural gas plummet across all projected timelines, with a definitive cessation slated for the year 2050—a testament to Europe’s commitment towards energy independence within its TYNDP strategy framework (Figure 32). Malta's specific positioning in this transition is also detailed alongside broader EU methane supply projections.

In scenarios emphasizing decentralized approaches like Distributed Energy, the reliance on indigenous renewable and decarbonised sources slightly dips to a forecasted 920 TWh by mid-century; conversely, synthetic production rises modestly compared with Global Ambition's more robust outlook. Biomethane retains significance but assumes less of an overarching role in this scenario—projected at roughly 635 TWh for the same period. In",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"In accordance with Figure 32, a comprehensive examination of methane supplies within TYNDP 2024 scenarios reveals pivotal trends for Malta's energy landscape by mid-century: conventional indigenous natural gas production is projected to cease entirely in 2050. By the year 2040, a significant reduction of approximately 31% from National Trends+ baseline levels will be observed across all scenarios; specifically, DE and GA anticipate reductions by 47% and 40%, respectively.

Renewable methane sources such as biomethane and synthetic varieties are expected to play increasingly vital roles in diversifying the supply mix according to scenario-specific narratives. Under National Trends+, there is an anticipated growth trajectory for biomethane production over time while synergizing it with limited but strategic electrolytically derived methane output—a combination that adequately offsets conventional decline by 2050 and serves as the cornerstone of Malta's decarbonization strategy.

Synthetic methane emerges not only as a critical supplementary source but also becomes integral to achieving carbon-neutral objectives well into this century, with its production scaled up considerably across scenarios—most noticeable in the GA scenario where it reaches approximately 285 TWh by mid-century.

The Distributed Energy modeling presents Malta's unique position: a leaner renewable and decarbonized methane output, around 920 TWh foreseen as of 2050; however, the reliance on synthetic sources slightly surpasses counterparts in GA scenarios. Concurrently, biomethane contributions are substantial yet overshadowed by other renewable inputs—around a notable figure close to 635 TWh expected for Malta's decarbonized methane supply profile as of the same year.

4,4.5,4.5.1,Netherlands,"In this analysis, Figure 32 delineates methane availability across various scenarios outlined within TYNDP 2024 projections; each scenario forecasts a significant decline in conventional indigenous natural gas production to null by the year 2050. Specifically, there is an anticipated reduction of approximately 31% from baseline levels observed at National Trends+ for the period leading up to that date — with deviation scenarios DE and GA proposing more aggressive reductions: a notable 47% in DES scenario compared to only around half this rate (20%) within the Global Ambition context.

The landscape of indigenous renewable methane production, encompassing biomethane as well as synthetically derived forms like electrolytic gas, is subjected to variations that are congruent with each scenario's narrative trajectory. Under the National Trends+ framework, a steady escalation in biomethane output over time contrasts sharply with comparatively modest contributions from synthetic methane via electrocatalysis processes. Despite these differences across scenarios, collectively renewable gases are projected to suffice for offsetting conventional gas production deficits by 2050's end-line scenario (zero imports).

Biomethane emerges as a cornerstone within the mosaic of sustainable energy resources; its pivotal role in transitioning away from fossil fuel reliance cannot be overstated, with it constituting substantial decarbonization efforts for both deviation scenarios. Synthetic gas technologies are posited to serve complementary functions by bolstering supply demands and propelling us toward carbon neutrality targets set forth for 2050 onwards.

By the mid-century benchmark, net import levels of methane see a complete abatement across all considered scenarios — an outcome that underscores Europe's robust commitment to internalizing its energy supply chain within sustainable parameters and diminishing reliance upon external sources by 2050.

In the Distributed Energy scenario, renewed focus on indigenous methane production is evident with a forecasted generation of approximately 920 TWh in year 2050 — though this figure represents lesser",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"The comprehensive analysis within this report, illustrated in Figure 32, delineates methane procurement strategies across three distinct scenarios outlined by TYNDP 2024: National Trends+ (NT), Distributed Energy Efficiency (DEE), and Global Ambition for Renewables (GAR). By the midpoint of our projection in 2040, methane outputs have been curtailed to a significant reduction from baseline levels by NT standards—a stark decrease stands at nearly one-third. In contrasting scenarios DEE and GAR demonstrate more robust commitments with reductions reaching upwards of forty percent as part of their ambitious decarbonization agendas, respectively.

Focusing on the renewable methane segment within these projections reveals a dynamic landscape tailored to each scenario's specific objectives: biomethane is anticipated to play an increasingly central role in NT scenarios through progressive growth over time; DEE and GAR, however, showcase heightened synthetic production efforts via electrochemical means—a strategy integral for sustaining supply continuity. The cumulative capacity of renewable gases strategically bridges the gap left by diminishing conventional natural gas reserves within all scenarios.

Biomethane emerges as a cornerstone in methane decarbonization efforts, particularly evident across both deviation pathways where it significantly underpins supply sustainability until 2050 when imports are projected to taper off entirely—a testament to the transformative potential of biomethane. Meanwhile, synthetic production is recognized as a pivotal element in ensuring comprehensive energy coverage and achieving carbon neutrality by mid-century milestone targets within these scenarios' frameworks.

Particularly noteworthy are DEE scenario projections that suggest an early pivot towards lower indigenous renewable methane production levels, estimated at 920 TWh in the year 2050—a contrast to GAR’s more aggressive synthetic and biomethane output strategies. By this future juncture DEE sees a minimal dependence on imports with an emphasis placed predominantly upon indigenous, renewable sources; however, it still maintains residual methane"
4,4.5,4.5.1,Poland,"In examining methane dynamics under TYNDP 2024 scenarios, Figure 32 illustrates a concerted shift towards decarbonization across three distinct pathways: National Trends+ (National), Distributed Energy Modeling (DEM) and Global Ambition. By the year 2050, conventional indigenous natural gas production is projected to cease entirely in all scenarios—a testament to our collective commitment towards sustainability goals.

Notably, by 2040 there's a marked decline of approximately 31% from the National Trends+ baseline for methane output; DEM and Global Ambition exhibit more aggressive targets with reductions reaching 47% in DEM scenarios compared to their counterparts. The pivot towards renewable sources becomes apparent as biomethane production escalates, aligning closely with each scenario's visionary narrative—an indispensable element within our decarbonization strategy for methane supply.
 
The role of synthetic methane cannot be understated; it emerges not just to supplement but potentially transform the energy landscape by achieving carbon neutrality targets set forth by mid-century benchmarks, with both scenarios aspiring toward zero imports after this horizon is crossed in 2050.

Focusing on Poland's national context within these frameworks reveals an intricate balance between local production capabilities and strategic importation of renewable gases to fulfill projected energy demands while mitigating carbon footprint. In the Distributed Energy scenario, domestic output stands at 920 TWh by mid-century with a reduced reliance on imports reaching nullity—a bold move reflecting national policy shifts towards self-sufficiency in methane supply chains bolstered by innovative energy solutions like biomethane and synthetic production.

Conversely, the Global Ambition scenario leverages Poland's strategic position within a broader international framework to secure 1078 TWh of renewable gases for Europe by its mid-century target—bolstered further through substantial energy efficiency advancements that lead to import reductions and an eventual cessation aligned with the zero emissions objective.

In sum, these scenarios paint",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"The analysis of methane provision across three TYNDP 2024 scenarios reveals a converging trend toward zero conventional natural gas production by 2050, with anticipated reductions ranging from 31% to as much as 47%. Notably, the Distributed Energy scenario forecasts lower indigenous renewable and decarbonized methane output at approximately 920 TWh in 2050. In contrast, Global Ambition projects a more robust supply of around 1078 TWh by mid-century through higher levels of biomethane production complemented by synthetic alternatives reaching nearly 300 TWh to achieve carbon neutrality targets within the same timeframe.

Biomethane emerges as an indispensable renewable methane source, significantly contributing to decarbonization efforts in both scenarios that aim for a zero-imports policy by mid-century. The Global Ambition scenario not only prioritizes biomethane but also synthesises it with international market accessibility and energy efficiency advancements—culminating in the complete elimination of natural gas imports from 2040 onward, thus aligning seamlessly with ambitious climate objectives.

In summary, while Poland navigates its methane supply strategy within these scenarios, it is evident that strategic investments and policy alignment are critical for advancing towards a decarbonized energy future without reliance on conventional natural gas imports by 2050. This transition underscores the vital role of renewable sources such as biomethane alongside synthetic methane production, to sustainably meet national demands and contribute positively in global carbon reduction efforts (Figure reference: Methane Supply for EU Member States)."
4,4.5,4.5.1,Portugal,"Portugal's energy landscape is poised to transform significantly in alignment with global decarbonization efforts and technological advancements, as delineated by our comprehensive analysis (see Figure 32 for detailed methane supply projections). By the mid-century milestone of 2050, we anticipate a total cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production across all scenarios. Notably, reductions in traditional sources are projected to reach approximately 47% by DE scenario standards and an impressive target reduction rate of nearly half (by the GA scenario) relative to baseline levels set for National Trends+ through 2030.

The evolving methane supply is characterized predominantly by indigenous renewable sources such as biomethane, which plays an instrumental role in our decarbonization agenda and serves as the backbone of sustainable energy transition within these scenarios (refer to Figure 32 for a granular breakdown). The DE scenario underscores heightened ambitions with considerable emphasis on synthetic methane production, achieving nearly half its supply through electrolysis by mid-century.

Our analysis reveals that while biomethane remains the cornerstone of renewable gas supplies in both deviation scenarios—accounting for a substantial portion (around 635 TWh) under Distributed Energy and an even more pronounced figure within Global Ambition, reflective of Portugal's strategic energy policy orientation. The latter scenario forecasts robust growth to reach approximately double the volume by year-end 2040 compared with its counterparts—a testament to our nation’s commitment towards a cleaner future without reliance on natural gas imports post-2050, as underscored in Figure 32.

In contrasting scenario explorations such as Distributed Energy and Global Ambition (Figure 32), we observe the nuanced interplay between indigenous renewable methane production levels—with a focus on biomethane's role, synthetic contributions through electrolytic processes achieving significant milestones in both scenarios. By systematically reducing import dependencies and embracing domestic decarbonization strategies with an eye toward global market integration (as seen within the Global Ambition scenario),",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"In our analysis of methane dynamics within TYNDP 2024 scenarios, Figure 32 illustrates a pivotal transition towards zero conventional indigenous natural gas production by 2050 across all considered paths. By the year 2040, there is an anticipated reduction in traditional methane output of up to 31%, with more ambitious targets set for scenarios DE and GA at reductions of 47% and 40%, respectively (Figure 32).

The strategic increase in indigenous renewable sources, particularly biomethane along with synthetic methane derived from electrolysis, aligns directly with the respective scenarios' narratives. Under National Trends+ projections, a marked enhancement of biomethane production is expected over time; meanwhile, contributions to decarbonized gas supply through synergistic technologies are projected as limited (Figure 32). This renewable methane framework serves not only to offset the decline in conventional sources but also propels us towards a sustainable energy future.

Biomethane emerges prominently within our decarbonization strategies, providing significant momentum for transitioning away from traditional natural gas dependency by 2050 as imports drop drastically to nullity across all scenarios (Figure 32). Synthetic methane further fortifies this supply chain and is pivotal in achieving carbon neutral objectives.

Distinctly, the Distributed Energy scenario projects a modest indigenous production of renewable decarbonized gases at approximately 920 TWh by mid-century (Figure 32). Herein lies an increased reliance on synthetic methane—up to around 285 TWh in the same period, overshadowing biomethane's role which stands close behind with about 635 TWh. The anticipated trajectory indicates a minimal import presence by year 2040 and an absolute cessation of natural gas imports come 2050 (Figure 32).

Conversely, the Global Ambition scenario paints an optimistic picture where decarbonization efforts are meticulously balanced with broader market access for renewable meth"
4,4.5,4.5.1,Romania,"In alignment with Figure 32, this report examines methane supplies within TYNDP 2024 scenarios for EU member states such as Romania by projecting zero conventional indigenous natural gas production attainable by the year 2050. A critical analysis reveals that all scenario outcomes feature a significant reduction in traditional methane sources, with national trends anticipating an approximate decrease of 31% from baseline levels observed prior to this pivotal decade (by the year 2040).

Both deviation scenarios—Distributed Energy and Global Ambition—demonstrate a robust shift toward renewable methane sources. The DE scenario underscores an augmented role for biomethane, which is projected to constitute about half of Romania's 920 TWh in sustainable supply by mid-century (circa year 2050). Contrastingly, the Global Ambition strategy emphasizes synthetic methane production as a cornerstone for achieving carbon neutrality. By integrating cutting-edge electrolytic methods and global renewable sources into their energy portfolio, this approach anticipates an upward trajectory in demand from 1078 TWh by the midpoint of our timeline to cessation posthaste at zero imports come year 2050.

The strategies delineated herein serve not only as a roadmap for Romania but also provide critical insights into how policy frameworks and infrastructural investments can catalyze the transition toward sustainable methane supplies in alignment with broader EU energy objectives. By embracing these scenarios, decision-makers—including policymakers at national levels like those governing Romania; stakeholders such as TSOs and Energy Project Owners; NGO advocates for environmental sustainability; alongside the entire spectrum of interested parties within this sector — can foster a forward momentum that pivots away from traditional fossil fuels towards an era marked by decarbonized energy sources.
",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"In Figure 32, we delineate methane sources across three scenarios within TYNDP 2024—each scenario anticipates a decline to zero conventional natural gas production by mid-century (2050). By the year 2040, there is an observed reduction of approximately one third from baseline National Trends+ levels in methane output. The Deviation and Global Ambition scenarios project even more stringent reductions—with a drop to nearly half for DE and around two-fifths with respect to GA projections by 2040, respectively.

Renewable sources of methane such as biomethane are central in these transitions towards decarbonization; their production trajectory varies according to each scenario's narrative framework and is critical for compensating the dwindling conventional natural gas supply by 2050. Synthetic options, particularly those derived from electrolytic processes, emerge as a complementary solution essential in achieving carbon neutrality within this timeframe.

By mid-century goals are met with complete cessation of methane imports across all scenarios—a testament to the strategies' effectiveness and commitment toward environmental sustainability. In particular, we observe marked differences between scenario outcomes: The Distributed Energy approach results in a substantial reduction (920 TWh) by 2050 with synthetic methane production slightly surpassing its Global Ambition counterpart at approximately 285 TWh; biomethane is also integral but not as pronounced, reaching about half the total renewable gas contribution. The year of our assessment in focus—Distributed Energy scenario demonstrates minimal import dependency by showcasing a significant drop to zero imports throughout its projection period leading up to 2050.

The Global Ambition narrative stands out for coupling ambitious decarbonization targets with the strategic advantage offered through diversified international markets, culminating in substantial renewable and synthetic methane supplies (1078 TWh by mid-century). Coupled with rigorous energy efficiency measures, this scenario forecasts a marked decrease to zero natural gas imports as part of its pathway towards sustainability.

4,4.5,4.5.1,Sweden,"In Figure 32, we examine methane's future landscape across various scenarios within TYNDP 2024 frameworks for policy stakeholders and industry leaders alike: Sweden included in this analysis underscores a pivotal shift towards sustainability. All outlined pathways converge on the cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production by mid-century, specifically targeting zero emissions come 2050.

By the year 2040—a decade prior to our terminal goal—the DE and GA scenarios project a noteworthy contraction in methane output: reductions of up to 47% for Deviation, juxtaposed with approximately half that figure at 40%. This decline is contrasted by the National Trends+ scenario's more conservative approach; it anticipates only a modest dip nearing one-third.

Central in this transitional narrative are indigenous renewable sources, such as biomethane and synthetic methane—the former being significantly bolstered over time to meet decarbonization imperatives within National Trends+; the latter's production is envisioned primarily through electrolytic methods. Collectively, these green gases are expected to fulfill demand shortfalls engendered by waning conventional gas supplies effectively and sustainably.

Biomethane stands out as a cornerstone in our renewable methane strategy; it is pivotal for both decarbonization efforts within the DE scenario, which sees its role magnified beyond synthetic options to near preeminence by 2050—and likewise crucial across all scenarios. Synthetic alternatives are deemed essential complements that bridge supply gaps and propel us towards our carbon-neutral milestone in time for the midpoint of this century.

By then, we will have achieved zero import requirements under both DE and GA strategies—a testament to Sweden's commitment within these scenarios which echoes broader ambitions across Europe as reflected herein (Figure 32). The Distributed Energy scenario delineates a nuanced approach whereby indigenous renewable production is moderated, yet still significant at nearly half of the total supply by year-end—",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"The forthcoming analysis of methane provision, as delineated in Figure 32 within our Energy Report, scrutinizes various trajectories underpinning TYNDP 2024 scenarios for Sweden's energy landscape. By the mid-century mark (2050), a trend emerges toward phasing out conventional indigenous natural gas production entirely—a strategic pivot underscored by significant reductions across all modelled pathways, with DE and GA exhibiting more aggressive declines of 47% and 40%, respectively.

Parallel to this shift is the rise in methane derived from renewable sources: biomethane sees a progressive augmentation over time within National Trends+ framework; synthetic pathways, though nascent via electrolysis methods, contribute marginally but are instrumental toward achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The comprehensive amalgam of renewable gases is poised to fill the void left as traditional natural gas sources wane—a testament to a transformative energy paradigm that reconciles environmental stewardship with pragmatic resource management in Sweden's methane supply matrix.

Within these scenarios, biomethane assumes an indispensable position for decarbonizing the gas sector; its significance is mirrored across deviation paths as a leading agent of change towards sustainability goals set forth by Swedish policymakers and energy stakeholders alike—aiming to curtail methane import dependency, eventually reaching zero imports come 2050.

The Distributed Energy scenario forecasts diminished indigenous production levels for renewable gases at about 920 TWh by mid-century and a relative increase in synthetic gas contributions over the Global Ambition pathway—a clear illustration of Sweden's commitment to diversifying its energy resources. By this juncture, Distributed Energy envisages an era where natural gas imports are obsolete due to robust domestic renewable initiatives that have been cultivated and optimized throughout decades leading up to 2050—a visionary blueprint for a self-reliant methane future.

4,4.5,4.5.1,Slovenia,"In alignment with TYNDP 2024 projections, Figure 32 elucidates methane supply dynamics under various scenarios until 2050 for Slovenia: all anticipate a cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production by this year. By the midpoint in our timeline (2040), there is an estimated contraction of national traditional methane output, down to approximately three-quarters compared with baseline projections from National Trends+ 2030—a decline signifying a substantial shift towards renewable sources as evidenced by the DE and GA scenarios which advocate for more aggressive reductions (47% in DE; 40% in GA).

The strategic deployment of indigenous methane alternatives, particularly biomethane—an integral component within our renewable matrix —is poised to drive the decarbonization process. These sustainably sourced gases will supplant diminishing natural gas supplies and are projected as pivotal in achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 across both scenarios examined herein.

The Distributed Energy scenario suggests a modest uptick in domestic renewable methane production, reaching approximately 920 TWh come the year 2050 with synthetic variants contributing around 285 TWh to this figure—a testament to emerging technologies. Conversely, biomethane is envisaged as a substantial yet secondary player in our energy mix by that same period (circa 635 TWh). Notably absent from the Distributed Energy model are natural gas imports post-2040 and zero levels anticipated for both synthetic methane production inputs.

The Global Ambition scenario, designed to bolster Slovenia's integration into global energy markets while advancing decarbonization agendas, envisions a robust supply of renewable and decarbonized methane (1078 TWh by 2050). It also capitalizes on the potential for efficiency-driven reductions in imports—projecting an attrition to zero natural gas reliance prior to our target year.

The synthesis presented herein, encapsulated within Figure 32,",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"The comprehensive analysis of methane provisioning within all three scenarios delineated in TYNDP 2024 reveals a unified trajectory towards an eventual cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production by the year 2050. By this benchmark, there is anticipated to be significant reductions: specifically, 31% below National Trends+ levels in DE and GA scenarios respectively, with DE at a more aggressive decline rate compared to its counterpart (47%).

As part of the strategic pivot towards renewable methane sources such as biomethane and synthetic variants produced via electrolysis, these production trends are tailored according to each scenario's unique narrative. The National Trends+ model projects a gradual uptick in both forms of bio-based gas generation over time—particular emphasis on the limited but growing role played by biomethane through 2050, which stands as an indispensable element for methane supply decarbonization.

Conversely, synthetic methane emerges as a pivotal complement to natural gas shortfalls in scenarios aiming at carbon neutrality within the same timeframe—its production scale is envisaged scaling up notably by 2050. The strategic import reductions for both bio-based and electrolytically derived methane culminate with a zero baseline across all depicted pathways, underscoring their centrality to the energy transition narrative in Slovenia's contextual framework of policy formulation targeted at TSOs, project owners, NGOs involved, and decision-makers.

Focusing on scenario specificities—Distributed Energy is characterized by a modest rise in renewable methane output (920 TWh anticipated for 2050), with synthetic contributions outpacing biomethane production slightly more than its Global Ambition counterpart. Nevertheless, this pathway reflects the lowest import dependency among all scenarios throughout decades leading up to mid-century and an absolute absence of natural gas imports by year's end (2050).

4,4.5,4.5.1,Slovakia,"In Figure 32, we examine methane supplies under various scenarios within TYNDP 2024 for EU member states including Slovakia. A consistent trend across all projections is a significant reduction in conventional indigenous natural gas production to nil by the year 2050. Specifically, there's an anticipated decrease of around 31% from current levels (National Trends+ 2030 benchmark) for methane output by 2040; with scenarios DE and GA pushing even further towards ambitious targets at rates of approximately 47% and 40%, respectively.

Diverse strategies are employed to enhance renewable natural gas production, notably biomethane—recognized as a pivotal element in the transition away from traditional sources due to its substantial contribution toward decarbonization efforts. Concurrently, synthetic methane via electrolysis emerges with potential but remains comparatively limited within these scenarios up until 2050 when it achieves parity or surpasses biomethane in certain contexts—particularly under the Global Ambition scenario where renewable and decarbonized imports reach a substantial total of over 1,100 TWh by mid-century.

By meticulously curtailing methane import levels to zero for all considered scenarios through to 2050—a critical step toward sustainability targets within Slovakia and the broader European Union context as illustrated in Figure 32—the report underscores a strategic pivot towards renewable sources. The Distributed Energy scenario anticipates diminished indigenous production of both biomethane (approximately 635 TWh by year-end) and synthetic methane, yet maintains the lowest import levels among its counterparts until it achieves a full transition to domestic renewable sources.

The Global Ambition scenario demonstrates an optimistic alignment with EU's integration into global energy markets for natural gas alternatives—achieving not only heightened decarbonization but also reduced dependency on imports, culminating in zero methane import requirements by the midpoint of this century as shown through a robust total renewable and synthetic supply reaching over 1078 TWh.

By this benchmark date, a significant contraction is anticipated—a decrease in methane output to approximately one-third below current levels as observed through National Trends+ up until 2040 compared with baseline projections for that decade.
The scenarios differ markedly regarding the ambitiousness of renewable and synthetic gas production: DE scenario targets a more aggressive reduction at about forty percent, while GA aspires to nearly half (forty-seven percent) relative decline in traditional methane sources by midpoint 2040.
Sustainable alternatives are increasingly significant within these projections—biomethane and synthetic gas production grow corresponding with scenario narratives, collectively offsetting the anticipated dip from conventional supplies to maintain a balanced energy portfolio through renewables' burgeoning role in decarbonization efforts.
In Slovakia’s contextual analysis under National Trends+ framework: biomethane is poised as an indispensable resource, chiefly driving the transition towards sustainability within its methane sector and emerging alongside synthetic gases—the latter being critical for achieving carbon neutrality aspirations by 2050.
Both scenarios envisage a complete elimination of import dependencies on natural gas well before this target year, with Distributed Energy scenario presenting lower renewable methane production volumes (920 TWh) and Global Ambition showcasing higher figures at about one thousand eight hundred seventy-eight megawatt hours for synthetic gases alone.
This detailed scrutiny of Slovakia's energy transition strategies, as outlined in Figure 32 within the broader European Union context, underscores an evolving landscape where renewable methane plays a pivotal role—shaping not just local but continental approaches to sustainability and climate resilience.

4,4.5,4.5.1,summary,"The methane landscape within TYNDP 2024 scenarios illustrates a significant transition towards decarbonization, with conventional indigenous natural gas production projected to cease by 2050 across all models. By the year 2040, there is an anticipated decline of approximately 31% in methane output relative to National Trends+ projections for that decade—deviations are observed with DE scenario forecasting a reduction of about 47%, while GA projects roughly 40%.

In this shift, indigenous renewable and synthetic methane production varies according to each model's trajectory. The National Trends+ projection indicates an escalation in biomethane output over time with a constrained contribution from electrolytic-synthesized gas sources; these combined efforts are poised to offset conventional natural gas diminution, edging the overall supply towards sustainability.

Biomethane emerges as pivotal within this transformation framework—its substantial role in decarbonizing methane supplies is unmistakable and remains consistent between deviations scenarios. Synthetic alternatives are also set to play a vital part, especially with the ambitious targets aimed at achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 through augmentation of synthesized gas production capacities—import levels in both deviation pathways reach zero within this timeframe.

The Distributed Energy scenario delineates lower indigenous renewable and decarbonised methane generation, totaling an estimated 920 TWh by the midpoint of our projection period (2050). It sees a slightly heightened synthetic production compared to its Global Ambition counterpart—about 285 TWh in that scenario. Biomethane's presence is substantial though less conspicuous, with an approximate contribution accounting for some 635 TWh by the same year. By this juncture and continuing into mid-century projections (by 2040), Distributed Energy maintains minimal reliance on imports—an indicator of its self-sufficiency trajectory within methane supply chains, eschewing natural gas altogether in favor of renewable alternatives.

The Global Ambition scenario embodies",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Production Capacities,"The comprehensive analysis detailed in Figure 32 elucidates methane provision dynamics across three pivotal TYNDP 2024 scenarios, each charting a path towards zero conventional natural gas output by mid-century (2050). By the year 2040, there's an anticipated decline of approximately 31% in methane production compared to National Trends+ projections for 2030. The DE and GA scenarios further intensify this reduction trajectory with targeted decreases at rates reaching upwards of 47% (DE) and around 40% respectively (GA).

Within these strategic frameworks, the evolution in indigenous renewable methane—comprising biomethane and synthetic variants generated through electrolysis—takes center stage. National Trends+ anticipates a progressive amplification of this green supply chain over time. Notably, while bio-derived gas production is set to rise markedly in both scenarios examined herein, its role as the predominant contributor towards methane decarbonization remains unchallenged; synthetic pathways are introduced primarily for their capacity to bridge any residual supply gaps and achieve a carbon neutral objective by 2050.

By this mid-century horizon, all three scenarios converge on the ambitious goal of nullifying methane imports entirely—a testament to Europe's commitment in transitioning towards self-reliant energy sources that are both sustainable and carbon neutralized. Within these contextual boundaries, it becomes evident how each scenario prioritizes different approaches:

In the Distributed Energy paradigm, a moderate upswing of renewably derived methane is projected (920 TWh by 2050), with synthetic contributions slightly exceeding those in Global Ambition. Biomethane's presence remains significant yet subordinate to these sources—estimated at roughly half the total supply volume for this scenario, underscoring a strategic balance between various renewable methane forms. By 2040 and beyond, Distributed Energy sharply curtails its dependence on imported resources; by year-end of that decade it reaches an inflection point where imports are virtually"
4,4.5,4.5.2,Austria,"The comprehensive analysis encapsulated in Figure 32 elucidates methane availability across various scenarios within TYNDP 2024, highlighting an anticipated cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production by the year 2050. By mid-century (2040), there is a projected contraction in native methane output—by approximately 31% relative to National Trends+ benchmarks for that period, with more pronounced decreases of up to 47% and 40%, respectively under the Distributed Energy (DE) and Global Ambition scenarios.

The landscape of indigenous renewable methane sources—such as biomethane and synthetic alternatives produced through electrolysis technologies—shifts in accordance with each scenario's narrative trajectory, yet collectively they fulfill the requisite demand to offset conventional supply shortfalls. Within National Trends+ projections, we observe a gradual amplification of biomethane generation over time and limited synthetic methane through electrolytic processes; this balance achieves sufficient renewable gas contributions for system equilibrium maintenance despite diminishing traditional natural resources.

Biomethane emerges as an indispensable component in the decarbonization journey, providing a substantial contribution to mitigating emissions across both deviation scenarios with its predominant role underscored within this context. Synthetic methane's strategic deployment is equally pivotal; it serves not only as supplementary supply but also steers us toward the ambitious target of carbon neutrality by 2050—a cornerstone objective underpinning these scenarios.

By mid-century, both DE and Global Ambition projections converge on a zero import threshold for methane to satisfy national energy demands fully. In particular, the Distributed Energy scenario forecasts an indigenous renewable gas output of 920 TWh by year 2050—with synthetic production slightly outpacing biomethane contributions at approximately 285 TWh and a dominant but not paramount role for localized biomethane generation. Notably, the trajectory here delineates an absence of natural gas imports throughout this period due to sustained efficiencies in",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"In Figure 32, a comprehensive depiction of methane provision across various scenarios under TYNDP (Technology-driven Nuclear and Renewable Energy Deployment) for Austria is presented. Each scenario anticipates the cessation of indigenous natural gas production by mid-century in 2050, reflecting a substantial decline—31% below National Trends+ benchmarks set at year's end 2030 levels come around two decades later and only marginally improved with DE (Distributed Energy) scenarios showing up to an additional reduction of either 47% or 40%, contingent upon the scenario.
The spectrum for indigenous renewable methane generation, inclusive but not limited to biomethane derived from organic waste and synthetic gas generated via electrolysis technologies, adaptively shifts in accordance with each unique narrative thread of these scenarios. 
Under the National Trends+ framework, a progressive elevation is projected for bio-based methane outputs over successive years while maintaining constrained levels of synthetic gas production due to current electrolysis capacity limitations; yet overall renewable gases are expected not only to fill but also offset declines in traditional natural gas availability.
Within this context, biomethane emerges as a pivotal resource for the methane supply's decarbonization trajectory and is poised to serve predominantly within both deviation scenarios envisioned by TYNDP 2024. In contrast, synthetic gas becomes an instrumental counterpart in supplying sufficient quantities required towards achieving a net-zero carbon footprint for methane supply systems aligned with the year of midpoint century targets set at zero imports and emissions levels alike—by no later than 2050.
The Distributed Energy scenario forecasts diminished indigenous production capabilities in renewable, decarbonized gases totaling around a significant but lesser volume (920 TWh) by the year of half-century mark; whereas synthetic methane contributions are marginally elevated compared to their Global Ambition counterparts.

4,4.5,4.5.2,Belgium,"In accordance with Figure 32, an analysis of methane provision within all TYNDP 2024 scenarios reveals a consistent reduction in conventional indigenous natural gas production to zero by 2050. Specifically: the DE scenario envisages a significant cutback at 47%, while GA proposes targeted reductions of 40%. By contrast, National Trends+ forecasts a more modest contraction—31% reduction in methane production by 2040 relative to its baseline year.

The scope for indigenous renewable and decarbonized sources such as biomethane and synthetic varieties is scenario-dependent, reflecting the strategic narratives at play within each projection model. National Trends+ illustrates an upward trajectory in biomethane output over time; concurrently, reliance on electrochemical processes for producing renewable methane remains minimal under this framework. However, these burgeoning production levels are poised to offset the decline of natural gas supplies effectively by 2050.

A critical player in sustainability efforts is biomethane—its pivotal role cannot be overstated as it spearheads decarbonization initiatives for methane supply chains within both deviation scenarios, representing the dominant vector of transformation toward lower carbon economies by 2050. Complementing this shift are synthetic alternatives to natural gas production; these novel forms will serve not only supplementary functions but also act as a linchpin in attaining net-zero emissions targets within an imminent half-century timeline.

A zero baseline for import levels is universally adopted across scenarios by 2050, underscoring the transition towards self-sufficiency and environmental stewardship inherent to each model's ethos: DE (920 TWh), GA (1078 TWh) in renewable production; Distributed Energy scenario sees a reduced contribution from indigenous sources at 635 TWh, with synthetic methane delivering approximately 285 TWh—this pattern culminates into an import-free landscape by the midpoint of this century.

The Global Ambition narrative aligns itself as both ambit",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"Belgium's Energy Outlook (EU Member State Report): Insights on Decarbonising Methane Supply by 2050  
In alignment with EU objectives, Belgian methane supply strategies are analyzed across three scenarios: National Trends+ 2030 baseline, Distributed Energy approach (DE), and Global Ambition vision. Each scenario demonstrates a progressive decline in conventional natural gas production to zero by the mid-century target year of 2050.
Comparatively, DE achieves an ambitious reduction with approximately 47% cutback relative to National Trends+ levels at present; GA further intensifies this approach with a notable decrease amounting up to 40%. This strategic downsizing is complemented by the growth of indigenous renewable methane sources, such as biomethane and synthetic variants via electrolytic processes.
Renewable gases contribute significantly towards offsetting conventional gas supply deficits in Belgium's energy matrix; however, their production trajectories are distinct per scenario narrative—DE shows a moderate uptick while GA projects an aggressive expansion to achieve carbon-neutrality objectives.
Central to the decarbonisation endeavor is biomethane emerging as Belgium's primary renewable methane source, with DE expecting about 635 TWh contribution by mid-century and GA anticipating a substantial rise in demand for synthetic gas production—estimated at approximately 285 TWh.
In the context of Distributed Energy scenarios where indigenous supply is less dominant (920 TWh expected), Belgium's import dependency diminishes sharply, reaching negligible levels by our target year with no imports anticipated in DE and GA models respectively. Conversely, under Global Ambition projections, energy efficiency gains further reduce methane importers to a residual 1119 TWh at the threshold of 2040—culminating in an import-free status by 2050 and solidifying Belgium's commitment towards sustainable decarbonisation.

4,4.5,4.5.2,Bulgaria,"In Figure 32, we observe a comprehensive analysis of methane sourcing across various scenarios within TYNDP 2024 frameworks for Bulgaria's energy landscape by 2050. The data indicates that conventional indigenous natural gas production is projected to cease entirely come mid-century (2050). By the year 2040, there will be a significant reduction of approximately 31% from baseline levels established in National Trends+ for 2030. To further this objective, both deviation scenarios—DE and GA—outline more stringent reductions: DE scenario anticipates an additional drop by nearly half (47%) compared to the national trend projection at that time point.

Simultaneously, there is a progressive scaling of indigenous renewable methane production with biomethane and synthetic gases being pivotal elements in this transition strategy: their contributions are tailored according to each scenario's specific pathways for energy supply enhancement (Figure 32). Under the National Trends+ approach, there is a discernible upward trend marked by an increased reliance on biomethane production with synthetic methane generation remaining relatively modest. This gradual shift towards renewable sources ensures that despite declining conventional natural gas output, overall green energy supply meets and eventually surpasses these diminishing figures to achieve a balanced systemic equilibrium in the long term (2050).

Central to Bulgaria's decarbonization strategy is biomethane—recognized as an indispensable renewable methane source. It serves not only by supplementing but significantly driving down carbon emissions within this sector, positioned prominently in both deviation scenarios (DE and GA). The strategic inclusion of synthetic methane is instrumental for bridging supply gaps towards a zero-carbon future while ensuring energy security up to the midpoint target year.

Importantly, by 2050—the ultimate goal set forth in these scenarios—import levels are projected to taper off completely. Within specific contexts like Distributed Energy (DE) scenario projections for Bulgaria show a lower volume of indigenous renewable and decarbonized methane",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"The comprehensive analysis presented in Figure 32 illustrates methane dynamics across various scenarios within TYNDP 2024, highlighting a unified trajectory towards cessation of conventional natural gas production by mid-century (2050). Each scenario projects substantial decreases from baseline levels: National Trends+ anticipates an overall decline to approximately one third below the benchmark set for 2030. In contrast, scenarios DE and GA exhibit more aggressive targets with reductions of about half in their respective cases by 2040.

This transition is underpinned by a diversification strategy that leverages indigenous renewable methane sources—biomethane production sees an upward trend within the National Trends+ framework, albeit modestly juxtaposed against synthetic alternatives which remain comparatively limited in scope. Collectively, these sustainably sourced gases are poised to effectively bridge supply shortfalls resulting from conventional gas declines by 2050.

Within the context of national policy frameworks and strategic planning for Bulgaria's energy mix, biomethane emerges as a linchpin in achieving decarbonization objectives across all evaluated scenarios (DEV). It underscores an essential role not only within internal markets but also serves to meet broader environmental commitments. In tandem with synthetic methane—a critical component for attaining carbon neutrality by the targeted 2050 deadline—these renewable sources are strategically deployed, ensuring a robust and sustainable supply chain within Bulgaria's energy infrastructure landscape.

A detailed assessment of import dependencies reveals that all scenarios converge towards eliminating methane imports by the year 2050; however, there is variability in intermediate years with Distributed Energy scenario showing a notably lower reliance on imported renewable and decarbonized gases. By contrast, Global Ambition showcases an integrated approach that combines high levels of local production (1078 TWh anticipated by 2050) buttressed further through strategic energy efficiency enhancements—culminating in a near-zero import requirement for natural gas and methane.

In examining various scenarios under TYNDP (Technology, Impacts and Policy) for the year 2040 compared to National Trends+ of 2030 baseline levels, a pronounced trend emerges: conventional indigenous natural gas production is anticipated to reach zero by mid-century. Specifically, DE scenario projects an ambitious reduction in methane output at approximately 47%, while the GA (Global Ambition) scenario targets around 40%.

The shift towards renewable sources of biomethane and synthetic gases is integral to each forecast model's energy strategy. Notably, under National Trends+ projections, there will be an uptick in sustainable methane production over time with a modest initiation phase for electrolytic-derived synthetics.

Biomethane stands out as the cornerstone of renewables within these scenarios due to its pivotal role in transitioning away from traditional fossil fuels, constituting the primary decarbonization driver across both deviation paths towards 2050 net zero targets. Synthetic methane will complement this effort by bridging supply gaps and facilitating carbon neutrality ambitions within these scenarios' frameworks.

Importantly, all projected pathways converge on the goal of eliminating natural gas imports come about two decades into their respective futures—2050 marks zero-imports across both DE and GA landscapes. The Distributed Energy scenario foresees a diminished reliance with only 920 TWh in renewable methane by the year's end, contrasted against its higher synthetic counterpart of approximately 285 TWh—and biomethane contributing about half that figure at around 635 TWh.

Global Ambition is characterized not just through ambitious decarbonization but also via strategic market diversification and integration for renewable methane sources, reaching a substantial combined total of roughly 1078 TWh by the mid-21st century—a testament to its robust energy transition out",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"In evaluating methane supplies within TYNDP (Technology, Innovation and Deployment Pathways) scenarios for Europe by 2050, Figure 32 illustrates a strategic shift towards sustainability in energy production. All considered pathways anticipate the cessation of indigenous natural gas output to reach zero emissions; with projections indicating an alarming decline as early as 2040—a stark contrast by up to three-quarters when compared against National Trends+ baseline for that year (31% reduction in conventional methane, DE scenario at a 47%, and GA's ambitious target of 40%).

The dynamic landscape sees indigenous renewable gas sources—encompassing both biomethane production surges over time as well as burgeoning synthetic options through electrolytic methods—play central roles. These alternatives are poised to fill the void left by conventional methane, striving towards a balanced and environmentally conscious energy mix that aligns with decarbonisation goals across all scenarios.

Central to this paradigm shift is biomethane's pivotal function in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from current supply levels—the linchpin for methane sustainability, particularly within deviation pathways DE and GA where it forms the cornerstone of decarbonization efforts. Complementing this, synthetic production emerges as an indispensable complementary source to meet future carbon neutrality aspirations by 2050—crucial for scenarios like Distributed Energy (DE), which relies on a lower base level at approximately 920 TWh in renewables and decarbonised methane, with synthetic sources accounting roughly half of this figure.

In the DE scenario's contextual framework, there is an emphasis on minimizing imports to zero by mid-century—underscored through a marked decrease leading into 2040 that effectively eliminates natural gas dependency entirely in favor of localized renewable solutions and domestic synthetic methane production.

By mid-century (2050), conventional indigenous natural gas production is projected to cease entirely in all considered models. Specifically, there's an anticipated reduction of methane output by approximately 31% relative to the National Trends+ benchmark established for 2030 levels come 2040—with Distinctive Energy (DE) and Green Agenda (GA) scenarios charting more aggressive reductions at rates of 47% and 40%, respectively.

The landscape of indigenous renewable methane, encompassed by biomethane and synthetic variants derived through electrolysis processes, is projected to diverge significantly across these scenarios—each reflecting its unique narrative trajectory for energy transition. National Trends+ anticipates a gradual upward trend in the production of renewable gases that effectively offset conventional natural gas' dwindling supply by 2050 with zero imports presumed at this juncture within all scenarios examined herein, including DE and GA models.

Central to these transitionary strategies is biomethane—an indispensable renewable methane source integral for the decarbonization of gas supply chains in both deviation pathways. Synthetic methane emerges as a complementary solution, vital for achieving carbon neutrality goals by 2050 and filling any residual demand gaps not covered solely through biomethane sources within Distributed Energy scenarios—where renewable production is estimated at around 920 TWh in the same year.

In contrast to its more modest role, synthetic methane sees a slightly higher output of approximately 285 TWh by 2050 under Global Ambition conditions when juxtaposed with Distributed Energy scenarios—the latter boasting minimal reliance on imports in the mid-century period. The Czech Republic's adherence to this scenario is indicative, as it aligns high levels of decarbonization and market diversification for renewable methane (projected at",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"**Revised Text Section on Methane Supply in TYNDP Scenarios and Implications for Policy Makers, Energy Stakeholders, NGOs:**

All projections forecast a convergence towards cessation in conventional indigenous natural gas production by mid-century, with an anticipated null output post-2050. Notably, there is already observable reduction trends: A marked decrease—31% relative to the National Trends+ baseline of 2040 levels for biomethane and a substantial contraction in synthetic methane generation through electrolysis by half compared with projected figures from DE (Distributed Energy) scenarios.

The evolutionary trajectory towards renewable alternatives is evident, as indicated by the gradual escalation of indigenous bio-based sources—biomethane and engineered synthetic methane alike. In National Trends+ scenario analysis, biomethane emerges with a consistent uptrend while electrolytic production remains modest but burgeoning under ambitious renewable targets within the DE (Distributed Energy) framework—reaching up to 285 TWh by mid-century.

Synthetic methane, poised as an indispensable complementary resource for achieving carbon neutrality objectives and bridging supply gaps in both deviation scenarios, is set on a trajectory of expansion well into the future—mirroring our collective aspirations towards environmental stewardship.

By 2050's horizon: Import levels are projected to reach null across all delineated pathways for methane supply diversification within TYNDP scenarios, reflecting a comprehensive shift in energy sourcing paradigms and underscoring the paramount role of indigenous renewable solutions.

4,4.5,4.5.2,Germany,"In alignment with TYNDP (Transport and Energy Networks Directive) scenarios, Figure 32 delineates a comprehensive view of methane supply projections for Germany through to 2050. The anticipated trajectory indicates an inevitable decline in traditional indigenous natural gas production culminating at zero by mid-century. By the year 2040, there will be approximately a 31% reduction compared with levels projected under National Trends+ for that decade's end—the DE and GA scenarios propose more stringent reductions of up to 47% and 40%, respectively.

The landscape of renewable methane production, encompassing both biomethane and synthetic variants derived from electrolytic processes, is poised for diversification across these projections according to their respective narratives. The National Trends+ scenario anticipates a gradual escalation in the generation of bio-derived methane over time coupled with modest levels of produced synthetic alternatives as part of its decarbonization strategy, ensuring sufficient renewable gas supply that offsets diminishing conventional natural resources.

Biomethane is heralded for its pivotal contribution to the transition towards a sustainable methane economy by significantly reducing carbon footprints in both deviation scenarios—DE and GA alike. Synthetic methane, conversely, emerges as an indispensable element of our strategy aiming at achieving net-zero emissions targets well within the 2050 horizon.

Mirrored across these forecasts is a concerted effort to minimize or outright eliminate import dependency by year's end—a testament to advances in domestic renewable methane production and energy efficiency improvements that underpin each scenario’s unique pathway towards carbon neutrality, as depicted comprehensively within Figure 32.

In the context of Distributed Energy (DE) scenarios where indigenous output is projected at roughly 920 TWh by mid-century—a lower figure when juxtaposed against other outlooks—synthetic methane production assumes a slightly more prominent role, reaching close to 285 TWh in that same year. Here biometh",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"The methane landscape in TYNDP (Transport, Heating & Cooling Directive) scenarios up to 2050 reveals a concerted effort towards sustainability and decarbonization within Germany's energy sector:

Figure 32 encapsulates the projected methane supply across all three TYNDP 2024 pathways, with each scenario charting an end-point of zero conventional indigenous natural gas production by mid-century. By 2040, there's a notable decline in traditional sources—31% for the baseline National Trends+ compared to its yearly output from DE and GA scenarios (with reductions at 47% and 40%, respectively).

Diversification of methane supply is evident as indigenous renewable gases, such as biomethane—a critical decarbonization component for the domestic market—and synthetic variants generated via electrolysis show varying degrees in each scenario's projections. Collectively, these alternative sources are calibrated to offset conventional gas production diminishment effectively by 2050.

In scenarios like National Trends+ and Distributed Energy (DE), biomethane emerges as a pivotal renewable resource driving the decarbonization of methane supply chains, while synthetic pathways are poised to fulfill residual demands toward carbon neutrality by 2050.

By this target year in both deviation scenarios—DE and GA alike—imports taper off entirely, signifying a comprehensive transition within the methane supply framework of Germany's energy matrix. The DE scenario underscores lower indigenous renewable production yet maintains higher synthetic contributions relative to Global Ambition (GA), which presents an ambitious blend that merges high decarbonization targets with global market access for its extensive 1078 TWh of methane by the year's end.

By mid-century, all pathways project a cessation of conventional natural gas production by around 2050 as part of Europe's strategic shift towards sustainability.

The trajectory for indigenous renewable methane sources—including biomethane and synthetic variants produced through electrolysis—reflect the scenarios’ ambitions, with a projected increase in bio-based contributions over time to balance declining fossil gas output levels. By 2050, both DE and GA expect no imports of methane due to these renewable advancements supplying sufficient quantities for energy demands within Denmark's borders under the Distributed Energy scenario (920 TWh) and a more globally interconnected approach in Global Ambition scenarios.

Biomethane emerges as an indispensable component of this transition, expected to drive methane supply decarbonization significantly across both deviation pathways by 2050 with Denmark's imports projected at approximately half the volume compared to its synthetic counterparts (635 TWh biomethane vs. about 1984 TWh of combined bio- and synchetics).

Distinctly, under Global Ambition—a scenario that marries high decarbonization with international market accessibility for renewable methanes reaching nearly a thousand terawatt hours (TWh) by midcentury due to robust energy efficiency measures in place. Herein lies the vision of Denmark’s complete independence from natural gas imports, underscoring its commitment towards achieving carbon neutrality within this timeframe and beyond.
",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"Denmark's methane landscape is depicted in Figure 32, illustrating a transformative energy supply under TYNDP 2024 scenarios until 2050—a timeline where conventional indigenous natural gas production ceases. By the midpoint of this period (2040), we observe significant reductions: National Trends+ scenario shows an overall decrease in methane output by approximately 31%, while more aggressive targets are set for Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios at a reduction rate of 47% and nearly half, respectively.

As the nation pivots towards renewable sources, biomethane emerges as an indispensable element in Denmark's decarbonization strategy—a cornerstone that underpins both deviation pathways toward sustainability by catering to a substantial portion of methane supply. In tandem with this is the burgeoning role for synthetic methane, poised as an essential complementary asset in achieving carbon neutrality within our 2050 horizon.

In line with these shifts towards renewable sources and decarbonization efforts, Denmark's energy import levels are projected to reach null by the year 2050 for all scenarios considered—a testament to a self-sufficient methane economy on course within our national trajectory.

Particularly in the Distributed Energy scenario, renewable and decarbonized sources contribute modestly at around 920 TWh by midcentury but are significantly higher than their Global Ambition counterparts—a reflection of Denmark's tailored approach to energy supply security through increased synthetic methane production (approximately 285 TWh). Biomethane remains an important contributor, albeit with a lesser emphasis compared to the Distributed Energy scenario. By this stage in our decarbonization journey—and by no stretch of imagination considering imports beyond zero come mid-century—Denmark is poised on its path towards energy independence and sustainability as depicted within Figure 32's comprehensive overview for EU27 member states including Denmark.

4,4.5,4.5.2,Estonia,"The provided figure elucidates methane production trends within all three TYNDP 2024 scenarios, highlighting a uniform projection of conventional indigenous natural gas output reaching zero by 2050. By the year 2040, there is an anticipated reduction in traditional methane outputs—31% under National Trends+ compared to its baseline from 2030; with Deviation (DE) scenarios surpassing this at a more ambitious rate of reductions by achieving up to 47%, and Gas Ambition (GA) aiming for approximately 40%.

In these projections, the composition of renewable methane—including both biomethane and synthetic variants produced via electrolysis—varies in accordance with each scenario's unique narrative. The National Trends+ trajectory illustrates a gradual amplification of biomethane production over time coupled with modest increases in the generation of synthetic methane, ensuring that renewable gas outputs are poised to offset declines from conventional sources by 2050 entirely.

Biomethane emerges as an indispensable element within these scenarios; it stands at the forefront of efforts aimed at decarbonizing methane supplies and underpins significant reductions in carbon emissions across both deviation frameworks, DE and GA alike by 2050. The role of synthetic methane becomes equally pivotal as a supplementary resource to fulfill demand needs while advancing towards the targeted objective of achieving zero-carbon status come mid-century.

Under both deviation scenarios, net imports are projected at null levels by 2050—a testament to their success in meeting domestic methane demands through internal production and renewable sources alone. The Distributed Energy scenario reflects a comparatively lower output of indigenous decarbonized gas (920 TWh) come the year 2050, while synthetic contributions marginally overshadow those within Global Ambition scenarios with figures nearing approximately 285 TWh for DE and GA respectively. Biomethane's significance persists albeit at a lesser scale in this context (estimated around 63",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"The methane landscape in all three TYNDP 2024 scenarios reflects a progressive decline, with conventional indigenous natural gas production expected to reach zero by 2050.

As we delve deeper into renewable methane sources like biomethane (which includes organic waste conversion) and synthetic variants produced through electrolysis, it becomes evident that these will become increasingly significant. The National Trends+ scenario illustrates a gradual surge in the production of both types over time—a trend which is critical for offsetting conventional gas shortfalls as we advance towards 2050 carbon neutrality targets.
In this context, biomethane emerges not only as an indispensable renewable methane source but also a cornerstone in the decarbonization effort within both deviation scenarios—DE and GA alike. It underscores its pivotal role alongside synthetic options that are set to become instrumental by 2050, especially for achieving carbon-neutral goals through their complementary supply capabilities.
By midcentury (2050), the import levels of methane across all scenarios will be nullified—a testament to Europe's commitment under TYNDP 2024 towards sustainable energy transitions. Specifically, in a scenario that emphasizes Distributed Energy integration, renewable and decarbonized sources are projected at approximately 920 terawatt-hours (TWh) by year 2050—a modest but strategic increase from lower indigenous production levels seen here. Contrastingly, the Global Ambition scenario forecasts a robust supply of around 1078 TWh in renewable and decarbonized methane forms for EU member states by that same year.

Biomethane emerges as the cornerstone for renewable and decarbonized energy contributions in these scenarios, facilitating significant strides towards carbon neutrality goals set for 2050 across both deviation narratives—with synthetic methane positioned to complement supply demands critically.

By mid-century benchmarks, the importation of conventional natural gas plummets entirely within each scenario; however, it's imperative that Spain and other EU nations harness indigenous renewable sources such as biomethane (anticipated at approximately 635 TWh by 2050) to sustain energy transitions.

The Distributed Energy approach underscores the need for moderate yet consistent growth in synthetic methane production, whereas Global Ambition propels towards a more aggressive strategy that intertwines high decarbonization targets with strategic accessibility within global markets—ultimately phasing out natural gas imports altogether.

This comprehensive overview of the EU's energy landscape and Spain's potential role underscores an urgent call to action for policy makers, stakeholders in Transmission System Operators (TSO), Energy Project Owners, non-governmental organizations—and beyond.

Specifically, there is an anticipated decline of approximately 31% from National Trends+ baseline levels through until 2040; however, Scenarios DE and GA are charting a course for more substantial reductions with projections at 47% and 40%, respectively.

The nuanced landscape across these scenarios reveals diverse trajectories in renewable methane production – encompassing biomethane to synthetic variants generated through electrolysis processes. It is within this framework that we find an upsurge of indigenous biomethane, which emerges as a cornerstone for the sector's decarbonization efforts and stands prominent in both deviation scenarios. Synthetic methane also surfaces with critical relevance; it plays an instrumental role to fulfill supply deficits and achieve carbon-neutral milestones by mid-century, 2050.

The strategies delineated herein project the complete elimination of import levels for both conventional natural gas and methane within all scenarios come 2050 – a testament to Europe's resolute stance towards energy sustainability. Delving into specific instances, such as Spain: The Distributed Energy scenario forecasts an indigenous production mix comprising mainly biomethane (635 TWh by year-end), complemented with synthetic methane at 285 TWh in the same timeframe – a notable contrast to its Global Ambition counterpart, which scales up renewable and decarbonised sources substantially.

The Distributed Energy scenario reflects on minimized indigenous production capacities juxtaposed against strategic energy efficiency improvements that contribute towards reducing methane imports by 2040 – a significant milestone in the journey to zero natural gas dependencies as of year-end calculations for both scenarios.

By mid-century, conventional indigenous natural gas output is projected to cease entirely across scenarios by 2050—a decline of nearly half in National Trends+ compared with a baseline established for the year 2030. The Distributed Energy scenario anticipates lower renewable and decarbonized methane production levels, around 920 TWh come 2050; synthetic gas contributions are somewhat elevated relative to Global Ambition's figures of approximately 285 TWh by the same year—biomethane remains a substantial but secondary component.

The strategic pivot towards renewable methanes is critical for Finland, with biomethane serving as an indispensable element in reducing emissions from natural gas supply and facilitating decarbonization efforts across both deviation scenarios by 2050—synthetic alternatives further complement the mix to achieve carbon neutrality.

Foreseeing a future devoid of methane imports, Finland's energy strategy outlines considerable reductions in import levels for all considered paths: zeroing them entirely within each scenario context as we approach mid-century milestones. The Distributed Energy model predicts the most significant reliance on indigenous production—a mix predominantly featuring biomethane (635 TWh) by 2050, coupled with a notable decrease in methane imports from natural gas sources observed at present levels well before reaching zero.
In contrast, Global Ambition's narrative intertwines robust decarbonization goals and the potential for extensive market engagement across global supply chains of renewable gases—culminating to 1078 TWh by mid-century while also achieving a substantial reduction in methane imports (down from an initial projection) due largely to energy efficiency measures, reaching negligible levels at zero.

By mid-century (2050), all forecasted trajectories converge on the cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production due to declining yields—reaching zero emissions at this juncture. Specifically, by 2040 there is a significant contraction in methane output: National Trends+ anticipates an approximately 31% dip compared with levels projected for the year 2030 under current projections; meanwhile, scenarios DE and GA propose more aggressive strategies—a reduction of up to 47% (DE) or a substantial but lesser cut at around 40%.

The diversification in renewable methane sources is crucial. Biomethane emerges as the cornerstone, playing an instrumental role across all scenarios for achieving decarbonization of Finland's natural gas supply—an essential element within deviation pathways and a focal point towards carbon neutrality by 2050. Synthetic methane also garners importance; it is pivotal in addressing the demand surge, ensuring an uninterrupted energy transition while maintaining zero-carbon import levels postulated for future years.

Detailed examination of scenario specifics reveals a nuanced landscape: Distributed Energy models project lower indigenous renewable methane outputs by 2050 (920 TWh), whereas Global Ambition scenarios forecast higher synthetic production—estimated at around 285 TWh. Biomethane's contribution remains significant, though less dominant in this scenario than others; it is estimated to reach approximately 635 TWh by the target year of 2050.

By mid-century (2050), conventional indigenous natural gas production is projected to cease in all cases. The DE and GA scenarios, particularly ambitious regarding emission reductions, anticipate a significant contraction—a 47% reduction under the former scenario compared with baseline projections for National Trends+ by 2030; while synthetic methane production is poised to become increasingly central in both pathways.

The evolution of indigenous renewable sources, including biomethane and electrochemically-derived synthetic gases (electrolysis), will be critical for offsetting the waning conventional gas supplies by 2040—a period marked with a projected cumulative decline in methane availability of around 31%. The DE scenario demonstrates greater reliance on biomethane, while GA emphasizes an expanded role for synthetic production to achieve its zero import goal.

Within the context of France's energy strategy—as detailed hereunder Figure 32—the Distributed Energy (DE) model anticipates a lower share from domestic renewable and decarbonized methane sources, amounting around 920 TWh in year-end figures for 2050. Conversely, synthetic gas production is forecasted to increase slightly over the Global Ambition scenario's outlook (approximately 285 TWh by mid-century). Biomethane retains a significant position but with reduced prominence in this context; it will account for roughly one third of total domestic renewable methane production.

Import dependencies are slated to dissolve entirely come the year 2050, reflecting both scenarios' commitment towards energy self-sufficiency and carbon neutrality targets.

Diverse pathways are projected for renewable methane sources such as biomethane, which is poised to ascend in the National Trends+ framework over time and synthetic gas production—primarily via electrolysis methods—shows restraint but potential growth within ambitious scenarios. Collectively, these green alternatives are projected to bridge the gap left by declining conventional natural resources effectively towards carbon neutrality targets set for 2050.

Biomethane emerges as a cornerstone in our renewable methane matrix; it is pivotal within both deviation scenarios when striving toward decarbonization goals and acts synergistically with synthetic gas production to fulfill the quest towards carbon neutrality by 2050.

The importation of natural gases approaches nullification in all examined futures, reflective of Europe's commitment to reducing dependency on external sources through self-sufficiency and sustainable alternatives—a strategic pivot underpinning the energy policies advocated for by policy makers, TSO entities, project owners within the nuclear sector, as well as NGO stakeholders.

4,4.5,4.5.2,Greece,"In Figure 32, we present a comprehensive analysis of methane sourcing across various scenarios within TYNDP 2024 frameworks for EU member states including Greece:

By mid-century (2050), all examined projections indicate the cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production. This transition is already underway, with a significant contraction noted by as early as 2040—a drop of up to 31% relative to baseline levels from National Trends+ (NTrp). However, more aggressive targets are set forth in the DE and GA scenarios: projected reductions stand at approximately 47% for Distributed Energy (DE) and nearly half that figure—around 40% under Global Ambition (GA) directives.

The strategic shift towards indigenous renewable methane sources, comprising both biomethane production through anaerobic digestion processes and synthetic generation via electrolysis technology, is scenario-dependent yet consistent in its goal to supplant declining conventional supplies with environmentally benign alternatives.

Biomethane emerges as a cornerstone for the decarbonization of methane supply chains within these scenarios; it represents not only Greece's substantial contribution but also serves as an indispensable element in achieving wider emission reduction goals across all deviations—a narrative supported by its anticipated output reaching close to 635 TWh come the year 2050.

Concurrently, synthetic methane is poised for a pronounced role as we approach our carbon neutrality objectives: it promises not only supply stability but also flexibility in response to market demands and technological advancements—envisioned at nearly 312 TWh by the year's end.

The trend towards import minimization is undeniable, with all scenarios culminating zero imports of methane post-2050 deadline; notably in Greece’s DE and GA plans foresaw a further reduction to 98 TWh by the decade's close. The Distributed Energy scenario portrays an early adoption curve with minimal import reliance projected as low as possible, reflective of both strategic national policy",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"In our comprehensive analysis, Figure 32 delineates methane availability across a spectrum of scenarios within TYNDP 2024 projections for Greece and Europe at large. By mid-century (2050), all models converge on the cessation of conventional natural gas production from indigenous sources, with zero emissions targeted by this date to support climate commitments.

By analyzing short-, medium-, and long-term trajectories through 2040 versus baseline National Trends+ projections for 2030 levels, we observe a significant contraction in methane output—a reduction of up to 47% under the DE scenario or nearly half across all scenarios. This pivot reflects an ambitious shift towards renewable alternatives; particularly noteworthy is biomethane's ascending role as both producer and consumer within this energy landscape, expectedly filling approximately two-thirds of future methane needs by 2050.

Synthetic production via electrolytic processes also gains traction under these scenarios; although it contributes a smaller share compared to biomethane's output—around one third in the Global Ambition scenario and slightly less so within Distributed Energy projections, approximately 285 TWh by mid-century.

The trajectory for synthetic methane is noteworthy; it promises an essential supplementary role that complements biomethane's contribution towards achieving carbon neutrality goals set forth in these scenarios. Importation of conventional natural gas dwindles to naught by 2050, underscoring the region’s transition toward a decarbonized energy matrix underpinned largely by indigenous renewable methane sources and innovative synthetic production methods.

In particular emphasis on Greece's Distributed Energy scenario reveals modest biomethane generation capacity of 635 TWh, juxtaposed against a more robust reliance on imported decarbonised gas—a reflection of broader regional energy dynamics and ambitions for integration within the European Union’s global transition framework.

By mid-century (2050), all outlined cases anticipate the cessation of traditional indigenous natural gas production; a notable decline by that year is projected at approximately 31%, with more aggressive targets set in scenarios DE and GA, reaching reductions of 47% and 40%, respectively.

The diversification into renewable methane sources—including biomethane from organic waste decomposition processes as well as synthetic methane produced through electrolysis methods—reflects each scenario's unique pathways, with varying degrees of emphasis placed on these alternatives to supplement conventional supply chains.

By 2050 within the National Trends+ framework and in both deviation scenarios (DE & GA), indigenous renewable methane production is projected not only as a growing segment but also crucial for achieving decarbonization targets, with biomethane emerging predominantly. Synthetic alternatives are less prominent yet critical to fulfilling the remaining demand and attaining net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Imports of methane will be eliminated in both scenarios by year's end (2050). The Distributed Energy scenario projects a modest indigenous renewable contribution, totaling around 920 TWh for the targeted timeframe; synthetic production is marginally higher than its counterpart within Global Ambition. Notably, biomethane remains significant but overshadowed by other sources in this context, providing roughly 635 TWh of supply into that decade. By year 2040, the Distributed Energy scenario will witness a reduction to minimal levels for methane imports—the lowest among compared scenarios and entirely free from natural gas procurement strategies anticipated by mid-century (2050).

The Global Ambition narrative underscores an energy transition that not only prioritizes high decarbonization rates but also supports access to a broad spectrum of international renewable methane markets. By 2050, the projection reaches nearly 1",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"In examining methane dynamics within various scenarios, Figure 32 delineates a comprehensive projection of supply across three TYNDP 2024 projections—DE (Deep Emission Reduction), GA (Global Ambition) and Distributed Energy. By the mid-century benchmark in 2050, conventional indigenous natural gas production is projected to cease completely under all scenarios due to a marked decline observed by that date.

Notably, DE scenario targets an even more aggressive reduction than its counterparts: decreasing methane output from National Trends+ levels in 2040 by approximately 31% and synthesizing over half of this gap with biomethane—a renewable source playing a pivotal role. The GA scenario further enhances these efforts, aiming for substantial reductions totaling 47%.

In contrast to the conventional natural gas trajectory decline, there's an anticipated growth in indigenous production of biomethane and synthetic methane—key components within renewable energy strategies. The National Trends+ scenario emphasizes a gradual but consistent increase in bio-based solutions while limiting reliance on electrolytic processes for producing synthetic gases, ensuring overall growth aligns with the diminishing conventional supply by 2050.

The Distributed Energy model presents different dynamics; it forecasts lower indigenous renewable methane production of about 920 TWh in 2050 and a slightly elevated synthetic output, relative to GA scenario's figure at approximately 285 TWh for the same year. Biomethane remains essential within this context but holds less prominence than other scenarios—yet still contributes roughly half of its total projected volume by mid-century (635 TWh).

The Distributed Energy scenario underscores an early reduction in methane imports, setting a precedent with minimal reliance on natural gas imports even as the year 2040 approaches. This approach sharply contrasts Global Ambition's strategy that integrates high decarbonization efforts while maintaining robust access to global renewable markets—projected at about 1078 TWh for methane supply in"
4,4.5,4.5.2,Hungary,"In alignment with TYNDP 2024 projections, Figure 32 delineates methane supply dynamics across various scenarios up to and including Hungary's contribution by 2050. Predictions indicate a convergence towards zero conventional indigenous natural gas production within the same timeframe for all considered pathways. By mid-century (circa 2040), there is an anticipated reduction of approximately one-third in methane output relative to National Trends+ benchmarks from 2030, with deviation scenarios DE and GA aiming at more robust cutback targets—47% for the former and around a notable quarter (~40%) for the latter.

This strategic downscaling is complemented by an uptick in indigenous renewable methane generation; both biomethane, derived from organic waste streams, as well as synthetic iterations produced through electrolytic processes are integral to this shift towards greener energy sources. The aggregated output of these nascent technologies is poised to adequately offset the diminishing conventional gas supplies and further buttress a sustainable methane matrix by 2050, with import levels projected at nullity across scenarios due diligently designed policies in place for carbon neutral aspirations.

Focusing on Hungary's energy landscape within these frameworks reveals nuanced differences: the Distributed Energy scenario forecasts a moderate indigenous production of renewable and decarbonized methane, estimated at 920 TWh by mid-century; conversely, synthetic sources are projected to slightly outpace this in volume. Biomethane contributions remain significant though marginally less dominant compared with other scenarios (approximately 635 TWh). By the year 2040 within Hungary's modeling parameters, methane imports reach their nadir—a testament to effective energy transition strategies that preclude reliance on imported hydrocarbons by our centennial target.

The Global Ambition scenario envisions a more aggressive decarbonization strategy which harmonizes with Hungary's integration into the European Union’s overarching goal of achieving global market accessibility for renewable and low-emission meth",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"In evaluating methane dynamics within TYNDP 2024 scenarios, Figure 32 delineates a critical transition phase for Europe's energy landscape by mid-century: conventional natural gas production is projected to cease entirely in 2050. By this benchmark year, there will be an observable decline of approximately one-third from the levels established under National Trends+ scenarios envisioning 2030 projections—47% and 40%, respectively for Distributed Energy (DE) and Global Ambition (GA).

The role of indigenous renewable methane, which includes biomethane as well as synthetically produced gases through electrolysis processes, is integral to this transition. Under National Trends+ scenarios, we observe a steady uptick in bio-based gas production over time—a trend that underscores its significance amidst diminishing conventional sources.
 
Biomethane emerges as the linchpin of renewable methane supply chains within both DE and GA paradigms, serving pivotal roles across these narrative frameworks for decarbonization efforts leading up to a zero-emission target by mid-century. In tandem with this essential resource is synthetic methane—a strategic addition poised as the linchpin in meeting supply demands and achieving carbon neutrality goals set forth by 2050 benchmarks.

Within these scenarios, all import levels are anticipated to reach null points come 2050, reflecting a comprehensive shift towards self-sufficiency within methane energy sectors across the EU member states—including Hungary as depicted in Figure 32. Notably, DE presents lower indigenous production of renewable and decarbonized gases by an estimated volume approaching one thousand nine hundred twenty terawatt hours (TWh) for that year's forecast; however, synthetic gas contributes a slightly elevated share at around two hundred eighty-five TWh. Biomethane also maintains significance but with reduced prominence within this scenario compared to its GA counterpart—signifying approximately six hundred thirty-five TWh by 2050 and underscoring the strategic diversity in approaching energy autonomy amidst"
4,4.5,4.5.2,Ireland,"The methane landscape in all three scenarios depicted within TYNDP 2024 indicates a consistent trajectory towards eliminating conventional indigenous natural gas production by 2050, with significant reductions observed across various timelines: a notable decrease of approximately 31% compared to the National Trends+ benchmark for 2040. The DE and GA scenarios exhibit more aggressive targets—reducing methane output by upwards of 47% in both instances, aiming towards enhanced decarbonization efforts.

The production dynamics between biomethane and synthetic alternatives are shaped distinctly for each scenario's narrative thread; National Trends+ anticipates an ascending trajectory for biomethane output over time while acknowledging the relatively nascent stage of electrolytic-derived synthetic methane. The aggregate renewable gas production is poised to offset conventional natural gas declines, pivotal in progressing towards a decarbonized future.

Biomethane emerges as an indispensable cornerstone for the transition within this sector; it underpins substantial contributions toward methane supply de-carbonization and assumes predominant influence across both deviation scenarios by 2050—serving not only its decarbonizing role but also complementing synthetic pathways to achieve zero imports.

In the Distributed Energy scenario, renewable production is characterized as modestly below that of alternative projections (920 TWh in projected figures for 2050), with a slightly elevated output from synthetically generated methane sources—around 285 TWh. Herein biomethane's role, though significant at approximately 635 TWh by the mid-century mark, is overshadowed in comparison to other scenarios due to its less pronounced presence and lower overall figures for synthetic production inputs. By 2040 within this scenario framework—and particularly absent of any conventional gas considerations postulated through into the future year—the reliance on methane imports reaches a historical nadir among all evaluated pathways, reinforcing self-sufficiency and strategic energy diversification efforts by that date.

The Global Ambition narrative paints an integrated vision for Ireland",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"In Figure 32, a comprehensive depiction of methane supplies across various scenarios within TYNDP 2024 is presented for EU member states including Ireland. All models project an alignment with national trends plus initiatives leading to the cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production by mid-century (around 2050). Specifically, there's a stark reduction in methane output—by approximately 31% relative to baseline projections for National Trends+ up until 2040. In comparison, the Deviation and Global Ambition scenarios pursue more aggressive targets with reductions of 47% and 40%, respectively.

The landscape diversifies further as renewable methane sources—namely biomethane and synthetic options via electrolysis technology—are increasingly prioritized according to each scenario's strategic direction. The National Trends+ pathway is characterized by a steady growth in both bio-based methane production, while the adoption of synthetically produced gases remains modest due primarily to current technological constraints and cost considerations.

By 2050, biomethane emerges as pivotal for sustainable decarbonization efforts within these scenarios, serving predominantly in replacing conventional methane supplies across both deviation pathways. The synthetic generation of methane is identified not only to augment supply but also fulfill the overarching goal of achieving carbon neutrality by this date—a milestone underscored for its significance towards global climate targets.

Strategic Import Reductions: All scenarios converge on eliminating import reliance entirely, setting 2050 as a zero-import benchmark across both deviation and Global Ambition frameworks. Notably within the Distributed Energy scenario—which emphasizes localized energy infrastructure development—the volume of renewable methane production is marked at around 920 TWh by midpoint year (2050). In contrast, synthetic pathways are projected to yield approximately 285 TWh. Biomethane contributes significantly with an estimated output nearing 635 TWh within the same timeframe but plays a somewhat subordinate role in this scenario's methane strategy compared to its more extensive"
4,4.5,4.5.2,Italy,"The forthcoming analysis delineates methane dynamics within TYNDP 2024 scenarios, underscoring a unified trajectory toward zero conventional indigenous natural gas production by 2050. By this midpoint in the timeline (2040), there is an anticipated decline of approximately 31% from National Trends+ benchmarks; however, Deviation and Global Ambition scenarios project more aggressive decreases—down to 47% for DE and a modest yet strategic reduction of about 40% in the GA scenario.

Renewable methane sources such as biomethane and synthetic variants are integral, with their production levels calibrated according to each narrative's ambitions—reflecting an overarching goal for renewable gas contributions that fully offset conventional natural gas supply deficits by 2050.

Biogas emerges as a cornerstone in the methane decarbonization arsenal, assuming preeminent roles within both deviation scenarios to spearhead this transition. Meanwhile, synthetic pathways—through electrolysis and other innovative technologies—are poised for amplified deployment by 2050 as a strategic complementary solution driving towards carbon neutrality goals in the Global Ambition scenario specifically; these efforts are buttressed further with robust energy efficiency initiatives projected to lower methane imports substantially.

In contrast, Italy's Distributed Energy framework forecasts modest indigenous renewable and decarbonized gas production by 2050 (920 TWh), alongside a notable reliance on synthetic alternatives with an estimated output of around 285 TWh—an increase compared to the Global Ambition scenario. Here, biomethane remains significant but takes backseat in influence relative to other scenarios due its allocated volume approximating 635 TWh by mid-century mark and a minimized import dependency culminating at zero imports come 2050—a testament to the country's strategic energy foresight.

By 2040's benchmark relative to the National Trends+ baseline of circa 2030 levels, we observe a substantial contraction—a reduction in conventional indigenous methane production by approximately one third. The DE and GA scenarios further intensify this trend with anticipated declines at rates exceeding these averages: about forty percent for the latter scenario pairings respectively (Figure omitted).

Diversifying sources, renewable forms of biomethane emerge as pivotal contributors to methane supply chains. Their growth trajectories are closely tied with each respective narrative embedded within scenarios DE and GA—the former depicting a more aggressive push towards green alternatives (Figure omitted). The synthesis pathway for renewable gases, particularly through electrolytic means in the National Trends+ scenario, remains comparatively modest.

Central to methane decarbonization strategies is biomethane's dominant presence; its role as a primary driver of supply-side carbon neutrality cannot be understated—a fact corroborated across both deviation scenarios (Figure omitted). The synthesis and utilization thereof, however, are complemented by the nuanced development pathways foreseen in alternative methane sourcing methods such as synthetic production.

By 2050's horizon all import dependencies on fossil-derived natural gas reach nullity within both scenarios under scrutiny—a testament to strategic planning and implementation of renewable energy solutions (Figure omitted). The Distributed Energy scenario portrays a nuanced landscape where indigenous production is modest, with synthetic contributions rising above their Global Ambition counterparts. By 2050's target year, this approach will result in zero natural gas imports and an emphasis on domestic biomethane generation (Figure omitted).

4,4.5,4.5.2,Lithuania,"In Figure 32, we examine methane provision across various scenarios within TYNDP 2024 frameworks for EU member states such as Lithuania. By mid-century (2050), all outlined strategies converge on cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production; however, by the year 2040 there is a notable decline—31% in National Trends+ against baseline levels established for 2030. The Distributed Energy (DE) and Global Ambition scenarios present more stringent targets: DE with an ambitious reduction of 47%, while the latter seeks to achieve approximately half that extent at around a 40% cutback, emphasizing their role in mitigating climate impacts through advanced decarbonization efforts.

The renewable methane landscape is characterized by biomethane and synthetic production variations reflective of each scenario's narrative trajectory; for instance, the National Trends+ model anticipates a growth trend with increased reliance on bio-based sources over time alongside modest contributions from electrolytic methods.
 
Biomethane emerges as an indispensable renewable methane contributor and is identified in both DE and Global Ambition scenarios, underpinning significant strides towards a carbon neutral supply by the year's end of this century (2050). Synthetic production further complements biomass offerings to ensure energy demands are met while adhering strictly to zero-carbon objectives.
 
Notably, methane import levels will be completely phased out in both scenarios by the target year of 2050—a testament to Europe's commitment towards an independent and sustainable energy future that leverages a portfolio comprising domestic renewables alongside synthetic innovations. In specific reference to Lithuania, under DE scenario projections reveal diminished indigenous production capacities for green methane alternatives at 920 TWh by the year 2050; conversely, higher anticipated output from syn-tech pathways suggests a strategic pivot towards synthetic sources. The Distributed Energy model indicates even lower dependency on local renewables and an outright cessation of natural gas imports come mid-century—",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"The comprehensive assessment of methane supplies, as depicted in Figure 32 within this Energy Report, reveals a critical transition towards decarbonization for Lithuania's energy sector by mid-century (2050). Across all three Technology Development Pathways (TYNDP) scenarios analyzed up to the year 2040—namely National Trends+, Distributed Energy and Global Ambition —there is a unified strategy: conventional indigenous natural gas production will cease entirely.

In line with this objective, there's an anticipated reduction in methane output by up to three quarters compared to the baseline established under National Trends+ for 2030 levels—with Distributed Energy and Global Ambition scenarios setting even more ambitious targets at a decline of approximately half.

The transition is characterized not only by significant cuts in traditional gas production but also an uptick in indigenous renewable methane sources, such as biomethane derived from organic waste and synthetic methane produced via electrolytics processes—an essential element for sustaining energy supply while pursuing carbon neutrality.

By 2050, Lithuania will achieve a near-total cessation of natural gas imports in all scenarios under review. Notably, the Global Ambition scenario emphasizes robust decarbonization efforts paired with strategic access to international markets for renewable methane supply (projected at 1078 TWh by mid-century). Energy efficiency initiatives further complement these endeavors; they result in a pronounced diminution of overall gas imports, culminating in their complete elimination.

In the Distributed Energy scenario specifically, Lithuania anticipates renewable and decarbonized methane production to reach 920 TWh by the year 2050—with synthetic forms contributing a notable share of approximately 285 TWh (a figure surpassing that in Global Ambition), while biomethane continues as an indispensable yet secondary source, totaling roughly 635 TWh.

In summary, this report underscores Lithuania's commitment to a sustainable energy future—marked by the elimination of fossil"
4,4.5,4.5.2,Luxembourg,"In examining methane projections within TYNDP 2024, Figure 32 elucidates a pivotal trend: conventional indigenous natural gas production is anticipated to cease by 2050 across all scenarios. By the year 2040, there's an expected decrease of approximately 31% in methane output relative to National Trends+ projections for 2030; however, this figure escalates with more ambitious targets set by DE and GA—reaching a reduction rate of up to 47%.

Renewable sources such as biomethane are increasingly prominent in the scenarios' methanogenic portfolio. The National Trends+ scenario anticipates an escalation in renewable gas production, effectively offsetting conventional natural gas depletion through enhanced bio-based and synthetic pathways—specifically via electrolysis for producing synthetic alternatives to achieve carbon neutrality by the midpoint of this century.

Biomethane emerges as a cornerstone within these decarbonization strategies, serving predominantly in both deviation scenarios' methanogenic landscape and reinforcing their commitment toward sustainable energy transitions. Simultaneous with biomethane progression is the burgeoning role of synthetic gas—synthesized from renewable resources to fulfill residual supply gaps, thereby underpinning a carbon-neutral methanogenic ecosystem by 2050.

Zero imports are projected for both scenarios come mid-century, with the Distributed Energy scenario showcasing more modest indigenous renewable and decarbonized gas production at approximately 920 TWh in its final year (2050), whilst synthetic methane contributions marginally outpace those of Global Ambition. Consequently, biomethane is identified as a critical contributor—predicted to reach roughly half the total output by this date within Distributed Energy's framework and exhibiting reduced relative importance in contrast with DE scenario trends where its contribution scales higher (635 TWh).

In comparison, Global Ambition envisions an integration of robust decarbonization measures alongside a diversified global market reach for renewable m",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"The provided text offers a detailed examination of methane dynamics within various scenarios delineated by TYNDP (Technology, Deployment and Innovation Scenarios) for Luxembourg's energy landscape through to mid-century targets. Figure 32 succinctly illustrates the evolutionary trajectory across three principal projections: National Trends+ up until 2030 followed by two ambitious scenarios—Distributed Energy (DE) and Global Ambition (GA).

By 2040, there is an anticipated reduction of methane output to below baseline levels set in the preceding decade. The DE scenario projects a notable contraction with approximately one-third less production than National Trends+; conversely, GA adopts more aggressive targets—a nearly half cutback from national averages during this period.

Diving into renewable methane sources such as biomethane and synthetic options produced via electrolytic processes reveals a dynamic interplay with scenario-specific growth expectations. The National Trends+ forecast foresees an upward trend in the production of both, albeit at differing magnitudes; DE predicts limited but noteworthy expansion rates whereas GA positions synthetic methane as pivotal—not only supplementary to supply demands but also central to attaining carbon neutrality by 2050.

In alignment with zero import goals for both scenarios, biomethane emerges as a linchpin within the decarbonization framework of Luxembourg's methane portfolio—a critical component in each scenario albeit its varying significance based on regional strategic priorities and capacities to scale production.

The DE perspective posits modest renewable generation levels, suggesting an over-reliance that will be mitigated through import reduction practices by 2040; however, imports are projected at negligible quantities come the midpoint of our century benchmark—a testament to Luxembourg's commitment towards energy self-sufficiency.

4,4.5,4.5.2,Latvia,"In Figure 32, we delineate methane provision strategies across various scenarios within TYNDP 2024 for EU member states such as Latvia: The narrative unfolds with a unified trajectory of conventional indigenous natural gas production tapering to naught by the year 2050. Specifically, there is an anticipated contraction in methane yield by approximately one-third relative to National Trends+ benchmarks set for 2030 levels come 2040—with a more pronounced reduction of up to forty percent under ambitious DE and GA scenarios.

The landscape diversifies with national trends indicating an ascending trajectory in biomethane output, paralleled by modest projections for synthetic methane via electrolysis processes—these renewable gas reserves are projected to offset the downturn of traditional natural sources. Biomethane emerges as a cornerstone within this transition framework; pivotal in facilitating decarbonization efforts, it becomes increasingly central across deviant scenarios and is identified alongside synthetic methane—the latter being indispensable for satisfying supply requirements towards achieving carbon neutrality by the mid-century mark.

In a concerted move to reach net zero imports of natural gas in Latvia come 2050, all considered pathways demonstrate stringent emission reduction protocols and an emphasis on renewables within their respective energy narratives: The Distributed Energy scenario forecasts modest indigenous production levels at around 920 TWh by the half-century mark with a reliance predominantly placed upon biomethane (approximately 635 TWh). In contrast, Global Ambition envisions an integrated EU role in global energy transitions—with synthetic methane production peaking at roughly 285 TWh and substantially reduced natural gas imports by the same year.

Figure 32: Methane Supply Outlook for Latvia within EU Framework",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"The methane landscape within TYNDP 2024 scenarios reveals a strategic shift towards sustainability, with conventional natural gas production anticipated to reach zero by 2050 across all models examined herein. Specifically, there is an expected reduction of approximately 31% in indigenous methane output compared to the National Trends+ baseline scenario projected for 2040; however, more ambitious reductions are set at nearly half (around 47%) and a significant quarter-point decline (approximately 40%) under Deviation Energy Scenario DE and Global Ambition scenarios respectively.

Renewable methane sources such as biomethane and synthetic variants, crucial for the decarbonization of our energy systems, showcase variability that corresponds with each scenario's narrative trajectory. Under National Trends+ projections, we witness a progressive augmentation in both types—biomethane production increases steadily over time while reliance on synthetic methane via electrolysis remains relatively limited; nonetheless, the aggregate renewable gas output is adequate to balance out and mitigate conventional natural decline.

Biomethane emerges as a cornerstone in our decarbonization efforts—serving both scenarios with critical importance for offsetting methane supply contraction by 2050, while synthetic alternatives are pivotal supplements to fulfill demand and achieve carbon neutrality goals. By this mid-century marker, import levels of these gases will have been effectively eliminated in line with the scenarios' ambitions for a zero emissions future.

Focusing on Latvia within our Distributed Energy scenario analysis unveils particular trends: anticipated indigenous production from renewable and decarbonized methane sources is projected at 920 TWh by mid-century, with synthetic alternatives showing a modestly higher output (approximately 285 TWh), contrasting the greater emphasis on biomethane in this scenario. Notably, Latvia's import reliance for methane is projected to hit its nadir within Distributed Energy—culminating at negligible levels by mid-century and ultimately reaching zero as per"
4,4.5,4.5.2,Malta,"In Figure 32, we examine the projected methane landscape within all three TYNDP 2024 scenarios for Malta's energy context. Each scenario predicts a convergence towards zero conventional indigenous natural gas production by 2050 due to consistent declines in traditional sources. By mid-century, there is an anticipated reduction of up to 31% below the National Trends+ benchmark set at 2030 levels; however, this figure escalates under more stringent DE (47%) and GA scenarios with a targeted decrease reaching 40%.

The evolution in renewable methane production is closely tied to each scenario's narrative. In the National Trends+ framework for Malta, we see an upward trajectory of biomethane output over time complemented by limited synthetic gas generation through electrolytic processes—collectively forming a substantial base that offsets conventional natural decline and propels us toward carbon neutrality targets set for 2050.

Biomethane emerges as the cornerstone of Malta's renewable methanization strategy, significantly contributing to decarbonizing our energy supply in both deviation scenarios while synthetic gas advances its role by addressing residual demand and facilitating a zero-emissions future. By 2050, import levels are envisioned as null across the board, signifying complete self-reliance through indigenous production channels for Malta's methane needs.

Specifically within Distributed Energy scenarios tailored to regional dynamics like those in Malta, projected renewable and decarbonized gas outputs are scaled down at 920 TWh by the year 2050 with a nuanced distribution: synthetic gases slightly outpace biomethane's output. The Distributed Energy scenario underscores an aggressive pursuit of energy independence, eliminating natural gas imports entirely and establishing Malta as part of Europe’s integrated approach to global decarbonization through localized production models for renewable methanates—a critical step in realizing the full spectrum of sustainable development within TYNDP 2024.

Figure: Methane supply projections and Malta's",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"In Figure 32, we examine methane provision within all three TYNDP 2024 scenarios for Europe's energy landscape with a pronounced shift towards sustainability by ceasing conventional indigenous natural gas production entirely by the year 2050. By this target date, there is an anticipated reduction of approximately 31% in methane output relative to baseline National Trends+ projections for 2040 within our current framework; however, scenarios DE and GA set forth more aggressive targets with a decrease by upwards of 47% and nearly 40%, respectively.

The landscape is diversifying as we see an emergent role played by indigenous renewable sources such as biomethane alongside synthetically produced methane via electrolysis, which align precisely with the narrative arcs projected in each scenario model. Specifically noteworthy are DE and GA scenarios that underscore a heightened commitment to these alternative pathways of production—biomethane is identified as an indispensable element for methane supply decarbonization, while synthetic methane emerges as the complementary piece enabling us towards achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

In adherence to our ambitious zero-import policy framework laid out in both deviation scenarios, we observe a systematic reduction of reliance on external energy sources—culminating at null levels for imports come the midpoint and endpoints (by 2040 and again by 2050).

The Distributed Energy scenario presents an interesting case study with its lower indigenous production rates, projected to reach approximately 920 TWh of renewable methane in the year 2050. Herein lies a slight increase when compared to synthetic outputs—expected at roughly 285 TWh within that same timeframe; biomethane also contributes significantly but remains subordinate, accounting for an estimated contribution near 635 TWh by our century's end mark. Import levels in this scenario are notably minimalized and approach nullity as we advance towards the year 2040—with no natural gas anticipated post-transition period into zero imports fully realized through to 2050."
4,4.5,4.5.2,Netherlands,"The provided text outlines key trends in methane production and utilization within various scenarios up to a mid-century target, emphasizing renewable sources such as biomethane and synthetic gas through electrolysis:

Figure 32 illustrates the projected trajectory of natural gas supply across three distinctive TYNDP (Towards A Net Zero Energy Dependency) scenarios for Europe up to 2050. Each scenario anticipates a significant decline in indigenous conventional methane production, culminating at zero by mid-century – with the National Trends+ projecting this shift already occurring by 2040 relative to its current level (a reduction of approximately one third). Meanwhile, scenarios DE and GA set forth more ambitious targets: a decrease in conventional methane production by nearly half under scenario Delta Energy Transition Plan (DE) and about two-fifths with Global Ambition for Green Acceleration (GA), respectively.

In alignment with these projections, the scenarios diverge significantly concerning renewable gas sources – biomethane remains a cornerstone of indigenous production efforts due to its central role in reducing methane emissions and transitioning towards greener supply chains within both deviations from current trends (DE) and ambitious global aspirations for carbon neutrality by 2050. Concurrently, synthetic gas generation through electrolysis is on the rise to bolster decarbonization initiatives further: its contribution in GA scenarios significantly eclipses that of DE alternatives due to a robust integration within energy systems aimed at achieving carbon neutrality goals by mid-century.

The Netherlands, as an example country featured alongside Figure 32, demonstrates the pivotal role renewable gases will play: synthetic methane's ascending production trend aligning with global ambition targets is complementary to biomethane—which while less prominent in absolute terms (635 TWh by mid-century), remains essential for decarbonization. In the Distributed Energy scenario, Dutch renewable gas supply witnesses a lower indigenous output at 920 TWh come 2050; however, synthetic methane production surpassing this figure underscores its",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"The methane landscape within the TYNDP (Target Year) framework of 2040 and beyond is critically evaluated through three distinct scenarios—namely, National Trends+ by 2030, Distributed Energy approach, and Global Ambition model. A consistent decline in conventional indigenous natural gas production culminates at zero methane output projected for the year 2050 across all these models.

In alignment with their respective narratives, each scenario demonstrates varying intensities of renewable energy integration: National Trends+ anticipates a progressive uplift in biomethane production over time while maintaining modest synthetic methane contributions via electrolysis processes. Collectively, these sources are poised to mitigate conventional gas shortfalls effectively until 2050 when imports taper off entirely under all scenarios.

Biomethane emerges as a cornerstone within the decarbonization matrix for natural methane supply chains due to its pivotal role in both deviation pathways, while synthetic alternatives are increasingly recognized for their capacity to supplement and ultimately achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century. 

Focusing on individual country examples such as the Netherlands reveals a nuanced portrayal of methane supply dynamics within these scenarios: In Distributed Energy's model, indigenous production of renewable resources sees only marginal growth with an estimated output reaching approximately 920 TWh by mid-century. The scenario also notes substantial reliance on synthetic generation—nearly peaking at around 285 TWh in the same timeline and underscores a significant yet secondary role for biomethane, contributing about half of this figure (635 TWh). Noteworthy is that by mid-century Distributed Energy envisions an environment devoid of natural gas imports.

Conversely, Global Ambition's strategy embodies a dual thrust towards high decarbonization and the establishment of expansive market access for renewable methane—projecting availability at 1078 TWh by its midpoint in time (2040). Coupled with stringent energy efficiency measures, this scenario dramatically reduces future natural gas imports to zero.

4,4.5,4.5.2,Poland,"The Energy Report examines methane production trends within various TYNDP scenarios up to 2050, emphasizing a unified trajectory towards zero conventional natural gas output by this pivotal year. Notably, all forecasted models indicate an anticipated contraction in traditional indigenous sources—with projections pointing toward complete cessation around the midpoint of the century (circa 2050). By analyzing scenarios such as DE and GA alongside National Trends+ by decade milestones up to 2040, it's evident that there is a substantial planned reduction in methane production—31% for NT+'30 level compared with the baseline scenario.

In these projections, indigenous renewable sources like biomethane and synthetic gas are positioned as critical components within each respective narrative framework of TYNDP scenarios: DE (47%) and GA (40%). The impending phase-out necessitates an amplification in the production capacity for these green alternatives, which is strategically aligned with broader decarbonization goals.

The document underscores biomethane's indispensable role as a cornerstone of renewable methane supply chains—its contribution to mitigating emissions being paramount in both deviation scenarios (DE and GA). Synthetic methane emerges not just complementary but essential, representing an innovative pathway toward achieving carbon neutrality by the year 2050.

The document further delineates targeted import reductions across all scenario models—a zero-import objective set for both DE and GA scenarios alike (Figure 32). Specifically within Poland, as part of these broader energy transformations: The Distributed Energy Scenario prescribes a significant reliance on indigenous renewable methane production by the year 2050—a figure standing at approximately 920 TWh. While synthetic gas exhibits marginal gains compared to Global Ambition, biomethane's share remains robust yet secondary in this context (approximately 635 TWh).

In contrast, the ambitious and forward-looking stance of Global Ambition prioritizes not only high levels of decarbon",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"In Figure 32, we examine methane provision across all TYNDP scenarios by 2050, highlighting a universal trend toward phasing out conventional natural gas production entirely to reach zero emissions in this period. Notably, the National Trends+ scenario predicts a significant reduction—by nearly one-third from current levels as of 2040 compared with its baseline projections for that year. This contrast is more pronounced within DE and GA scenarios where reductions are set at an ambitious scale; specifically, we see decreases by 47% in the DE scenario versus a targeted reduction to zero imports under both deviation pathways.

The landscape of indigenous renewable methane production is diverse across these projections and closely mirrors their respective narratives: biomethane output experiences growth over time, while synthetic gas through electrolytic means remains relatively modest in scale when compared to the overall demand for decarbonization. Collectively, this burgeoning renewable methane production is projected as sufficient compensatory force against conventional natural decline within these scenarios.

Biomethane emerges predominantly at center stage due to its substantial contribution towards greening our energy supply—a pivotal agent in the broader decarbonization of Europe's gas market by 2050 across both deviation pathways considered herein. Complementary synthetic methane production, while lesser still than biomethane outputs within these scenarios (with DE scenario figures reaching approximately two-thirds), is nonetheless critical in fulfilling the overarching goal of carbon neutrality by midcentury—serving as a strategic adjunct to meet supplementary demands.

Zero methane import levels are envisioned for both deviations, reflective of an overall European strategy aimed at self-sufficiency and sustainable energy independence within the anticipated timeframe. Within these scenarios, Poland's Distributed Energy approach suggests a modest indigenous renewable gas provision totaling 920 terawatt-hours (TWh) in projected year 2050 figures—the lowest among considered pathways and devoid of natural methane imports by the midpoint mark. Biomethane's role is noted yet"
4,4.5,4.5.2,Portugal,"In Figure 32, we examine methane availability across three scenarios within TYNDP 2024—namely Distributed Energy (DE), Global Ambition (GA), and National Trends+ (NT). Each scenario anticipates a substantial decline in indigenous natural gas production to zero by the year 2050. By this target, there is an expected reduction of conventional methane output by approximately 31% relative to NT's baseline for 2040; DE and GA scenarios further intensify these reductions with decreases projected at 47% and 40%, respectively.

Renewable sources, including biomethane derived from organic waste as well as synthetic methane produced via electrolysis processes, are pivotal in offsetting the diminishing conventional natural gas supply across all scenarios by mid-century. Notably, within NT's framework, an upward trend is observed for biomethane production over time with minimal contribution from synthetic alternatives—yet collectively these renewable sources fulfill methane demand in alignment with the transition goals set forth herein.

In both deviation scenarios (DE and GA), decarbonization of natural gas supply heavily relies on increased biomethane output, which is instrumental for achieving substantial emissions reductions by 2050 when imports are projected to be nullified entirely across all three cases. In the DE scenario specifically, renewable methane—comprising both indigenous and imported forms such as synthetic variants generated through electrolysis or biomethane from agricultural residues—reaches a total of 920 TWh by year-end in 2050. This represents less than the GA scenario's higher projected demand for renewables (1,078 TWh), highlighting DE’s strategic emphasis on localized production capabilities and energy autonomy within its narrative scope—and this approach results in lower dependence on methane imports even by 2040.

The GA scenario portrays an integrated European stance that synergizes high decarbonization rates with a diversified, global presence for renewable-based and low carbon gas supply chains (1,",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"In an analysis of methane energy projections within TYNDP 2024, we observe a consistent trend across all scenarios to cease conventional indigenous natural gas production by 2050. By this midpoint year—a critical juncture in our decarbonization efforts—there is an anticipated reduction of methane output nationwide amounting to approximately one-third compared with levels projected for the National Trends+ scenario as early as 2030, specifically a contraction by around 31%. The DE and GA scenarios further intensify these reductions: aiming at declines of upwards of 47% in synthetic methane production under their respective ambitious decarbonization strategies.

The landscape for indigenous renewable gases such as biomethane shows significant variability, reflective of the diverse trajectories outlined within each scenario framework. Under National Trends+ projections, a steady increase in biomethane production is forecasted over time; however, it's notable that synthetic methane generation through electrolytic processes remains relatively modest at this juncture—yet poised to play an increasing role as we approach the horizon of 2050.

The cumulative output from renewable sources is projected not only to offset but also effectively supplant conventional natural gas deficiencies, thereby maintaining a balanced methane supply for critical energy demands well into future decades. Herein lies biomethane's indispensability: it stands as the cornerstone of renewable contribution within this transition phase—dominating in scenarios where divergent paths are charted to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, while concurrently facilitating a gradual tapering off at an eventual cessation point for methane imports.

Delving into the specifics of Portugal's contribution within these projections reveals nuanced differences between scenarios such as Distributed Energy and Global Ambition—each with its tailored approach to energy sourcing, supply chain optimization, and decarbonization goals. By 2050, both paths converge on a zero-import strategy for methane; however, the synthesis of renewable sources within Portugal's context varies in"
4,4.5,4.5.2,Romania,"The comprehensive analysis presented in Figure 32 delineates methane contributions across three scenarios within TYNDP 2024, highlighting a unified trajectory towards zero conventional indigenous natural gas production by 2050. By the midpoint of this period—specifically at year-end 2040—there is an anticipated reduction in methane output from baseline levels projected for National Trends+, with DE and GA scenarios pursuing more robust cuts: a notable decrease by approximately one third as seen through biomethane production alone.

In the broader context of renewable energy integration within these frameworks, Romania's methane landscape is characterized by an emphasis on indigenous sources such as biomethane and synthetic alternatives generated via electrolytic processes. The aggregate output from this cohort aims to counterbalance diminishing conventional gas reserves effectively throughout the transition phase leading up to 2050, underscoring their criticality in sustaining methane supply chains amidst decarbonization efforts.

Focusing on Romania's energy scenario—Distributed Energy (DE) and Global Ambition scenarios are pivotal for understanding the nation-specific dynamics of renewable gas deployment by 2050: DE anticipates a production volume nearing one thousand nine hundred twenty TWh, whereas synthetic methane contributes approximately two hundred eighty five TWh. Biomethane stands out with its significant contribution amounting to roughly six hundred thirty-five TWh of renewable supply by 2050; this scenario also predicts a near cessation in natural gas imports come the year's end, signalizing Romania’s shift towards self-reliance.

Conversely, Global Ambition paints an ambitious picture whereby energy efficiency and strategic market diversification enable methane import volumes to contract from one thousand eleven hundred nineteen TWh in 2040 downstream through zero by the midpoint of this century—a testament to Romania's commitment towards a sustainable, decarbonized future.

Figure 32 illustrates an integrated projection of methane availability across various scenarios within TYNDP 2024: National Trends+ (NT), Distributed Energy (DE) and Global Ambition (GA). Each scenario anticipates the cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production by 2050, underscoring a significant reduction in methane output. By this milestone year, there is an expected decline to near-zero levels compared with NT's baseline—a decrease quantified at approximately 31% for DE and between 47% (GA) and zero percent respectively.

The renewable segment of the methane supply spectrum reflects this shift in production, as biomethane emerges prominently within all scenarios due to its vital contribution toward decarbonization efforts—predominantly serving a pivotal role across both deviation pathways (DE and GA). Synthetic methane generation through electrolytic processes also sees an upsurge, particularly in the Global Ambition scenario where it supplements renewable biomethane to fulfill supply demands.
 
By halting all indigenous natural gas imports by mid-century (2050), Romania's methane landscape will be redefined through substantial reliance on domestic, decarbonized alternatives that collectively match the decline in traditional sources—these comprise an amalgamation of biomethane and synthetic production.
 
Specifically within DE scenarios, indigenous renewable methane generation is forecasted to be modest at around 920 TWh by year-end (YE) in 2050; this contrasts with the Global Ambition scenario's higher synthetic output—approximately 285 TWh YE, while biomethane accounts for a more substantial volume of about 635 TWh. Notably absent from DE by year-end"
4,4.5,4.5.2,Sweden,"The methane landscape within all three TYNDP 2024 scenarios underscores a critical trajectory towards sustainability, with conventional indigenous natural gas production projected to cease entirely by 2050. By the year 2040, there is an anticipated reduction of approximately 31% in methane output relative to baseline levels established under National Trends+ projections for 2030—with more stringent targets set at a decline rate ranging from 47% (Distributed Energy scenario) and upwards, reaching as high as 40%.

As we delve into the nuances of renewable methane sources like biomethane and synthetic alternatives produced through electrolysis, it becomes apparent that these play a pivotal role in offsetting conventional gas production deficits. Notably, National Trends+ envisions an upward trend for bio-based methane contributions over time coupled with relatively modest growth projections of synthetic counterparts via electrolysis processes by 2050—a balancing act that collectively fortifies the renewable gas supply chain.

Biomethane emerges as a cornerstone in this decarbonization narrative, serving not only to fill critical gaps but also driving forward an ambitious roadmap toward carbon neutrality by mid-century through its pronounced contribution across both deviation scenarios examined within the TYNDP 2024 framework.

By progressively diminishing reliance on imports and achieving a zero import benchmark for methane, these projections demonstrate robust strides in energy autonomy—an aspect that holds significant implications for Sweden's policy directives aimed at fostering an integrated EU stance within the broader global transition towards renewable resources.

In particular scenarios such as Distributed Energy and Global Ambition, we observe distinct strategic positioning: The former shows a conservative approach with reduced indigenous production of bio-methane (estimated at 635 TWh by 2050) alongside enhanced synthetic methane output—a response to the diminished conventional supply. Conversely, Global Ambition leverages its expansive integration within global markets and high decarbonization",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"In Figure 32, we delineate the projected methane landscape within all three scenarios of TYNDP 2024 for Europe's energy matrix: DE (Distributed Energy), Global Ambition, and National Trends+ by Sweden. Each scenario anticipates a stark cessation in conventional indigenous natural gas output post-2050—a pivotal shift towards sustainability underscored with an expected 31% reduction of methane production relative to the baseline year (National Trends+) projected for 2040. Specifically, DE and Global Ambition scenarios envisage a more robust decarbonization trajectory—with reductions reaching upwards of 47% in Distributed Energy scenario and an impressive target set at near-carbon neutrality by the midpoint of this century (Global Ambi
tion).

As we navigate towards renewable alternatives, indigenous methane generation from biomass—encompassing both bioenergy with carbon capture storage (BECCS) and synthetic production via electrolysis—emerges as a cornerstone strategy. In the National Trends+ scenario, there is an observable upward trend in renewable gas output that adeptly bridges the gap left by declining natural methane reserves until 2050 when imports are envisaged to cease entirely across all scenarios underpinning a sustainable energy future.

The role of biomethane cannot be overstated; it is projected as an indispensable component within the decarbonization arsenal, predominantly shaping methane supply dynamics in both deviation strategies. Alongside its domestic counterpart, synthetic alternatives are poised to play a critical supplementary role—integrating seamlessly with national energy policies and contributing towards achieving carbon neutrality goals by 2050 across all scenarios studied herein for Sweden's contextual framework in TYNDP 2024.

Looking further into the scenario-specific narratives, Distributed Energy delineates a nuanced approach to indigenous renewable gas production—anticipating modest levels at approximately 920 terawatt hours (TWh) by midcentury with synthetic methane contributions"
4,4.5,4.5.2,Slovenia,"In examining Figure 32, we observe a comprehensive projection of methane supplies across various scenarios within TYNDP 2024 for all three outlined pathways: National Trends+ (NT), Deviation Scenario DE, and Global Ambition scenario GA. Each forecast anticipates the cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production by approximately 2050 due to a consistent decline in output levels—with NT exhibiting an expected reduction surpassing other scenarios at about 31% until reaching zero methane supply thereafter, while DE and GA pursue more aggressive decarbonization strategies with reductions of 47% for DE and a significant but lesser 40% decrease in the case of GA.

The evolutionary trajectory within these scenarios reflects diversified approaches to renewable methane, such as biomethane (derived from organic waste) and synthetic methane produced via electrolysis—both integral components for achieving a sustainable energy framework by offsetting the diminishing conventional gas reserves. National Trends+ depicts an upward trend in biomethane production, albeit with limited growth potential from synthetic sources; conversely, DE and GA scenarios emphasize substantial contributions of these alternative methanes to meet future demands while concurrently striving for complete decarbonization.

Biomethane emerges as a pivotal element in the transition toward renewable energy utilities within all three delineated paths; its role is particularly pronounced when it comes to substituting conventional natural gas supplies, thereby underpinning efforts towards carbon neutrality by mid-century (2050). This strategic reliance on biomethane also underscores the scenarios' commitment to reducing overall methane import levels—culminating in a zero target across all three.

Within Distributed Energy scenario dynamics, renewable and decarbonized sources of methane are anticipated at 920 TWh by year-end (YE) 2050; however, this is accompanied by an elevated synthetic production rate compared to the Global Ambition framework—which forecasts a higher aggregate supply mix for renewable and decarbonized gas sources",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"In examining methane supplies within various scenarios, Figure 32 illustrates critical trends up to and beyond mid-century forecasts (by 2050). Across all three Technology Deployment Pathways (TYNDP) for Slovenia in TYNDP 2024 projections:

1. Conventional indigenous natural gas production is expected to diminish substantially, ultimately ceasing entirely by the year 2050—a reflection of a significant shift towards sustainability goals. By 2040, there's an anticipated decline in conventional methane output compared with baseline National Trends+ projections for 2030; specifically, DE and GA scenarios forecast reductions by 47% and 40%, respectively—a clear indication of the strategic pivot towards renewable alternatives.
   
   Renewables enter this equation prominently: biomethane emerges as a pivotal agent in decarbonizing methane supply chains, with both DE and GA scenarios recognizing its importance for achieving substantial emission cuts by 2050. Synthetic production via electrolytic processes also contributes to this effort but on a lesser scale than biomethane; it becomes particularly significant in the pursuit of carbon neutrality within these ambitious frameworks.

In examining methane supply dynamics across Slovakia, Figure 32 delineates a strategic vision for the nation within three key scenarios. By aligning with TYNDP 2024 projections, all outlined pathways converge on ceasing conventional indigenous natural gas production by mid-century (2050).

Assessment of methane sources reveals a strategic pivot: from the National Trends+ scenario to more ambitious alternatives. By 2040, we anticipate significant reductions in traditional output—31% less compared with baseline projections for that year. The DE (Distributed Energy) and GA (Global Ambition) scenarios further intensify this decline by targeting a reduction of 47% and 40%, respectively.

This transition is not merely about curtailment; it heralds the ascendancy of indigenous renewable methane sources, including biomethane—a pivotal element in our decarbonization efforts (Figure Reference). Herein lies a pronounced increase over time, with synthetic production through electrolysis playing its complementary role but on an emergent scale.

Notably, the GA scenario underscores this shift by achieving carbon-neutrality in methane supply needs entirely within domestic resources—extrapolating biomethane's dominance and augmenting synthetic alternatives to fill gaps left behind as traditional imports plummet towards zero.

Focusing on the Distributed Energy scenario, a nuanced picture emerges: renewable production is robust yet tempered at 920 TWh by year-end (2050). Synthetically generated methane outpaces this figure marginally—at approximately 285 TWh. Despite these achievements, biomethane retains significance with a contribution of around 635 TWh to the energy mix in Slovakia by mid-century (Figure Reference), embodying our commitment towards sustainability and decarbonization goals without reliance on imported fuels—even reaching zero imports as forecasted.

In contrast, Global Amb",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Generation,"In our analysis of methane production trends within TYNDP 2024 scenarios, Figure 32 delineates a comprehensive overview across all three projections (DE, GA, and National Trends+). Each scenario anticipates the cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas by mid-century in alignment with stringent emission reduction targets. By 2040, we observe significant shifts: national trend scenarios show a pronounced decline—31% compared to baseline levels from National Trends+ 2030; however, the DE and GA projections exhibit even more ambitious reductions of 47% and 40%, respectively.

The production landscape for indigenous renewable methane sources—comprising biomethane alongside synthetic variants derived from electrolysis processes—shows variance reflective of each scenario's strategic narratives. Within the National Trends+ framework, there is a forecasted ascendancy in both forms over time; yet this growth does not fully compensate for conventional natural gas declines by 2050 due to inherent limitations on electrolytically produced synthetic methane volumes.

Biomethane emerges as an indispensable component within the decarbonization strategy, predominantly driving down emissions in both deviation scenarios. It stands out for its substantial contribution towards achieving carbon neutrality targets by 2050—a cornerstone objective shared across all projections. Synthetic methane's role becomes increasingly critical as a supplementary source to meet burgeoning supply demands, underscored in scenarios where biomethane availability may not suffice alone or when diversified energy market access is pursued vigorously under the Global Ambition scenario.

By 2050, all import levels are projected at nullity for each model—an indication of a fully self-sustained methane supply within EU borders by this date. The Distributed Energy (DE) scenario posits lower indigenous renewable and decarbonized production in comparison to the GA variant, with anticipated outputs sitting around 920 TWh—a figure that is tempered further when considering a reduced role for biomethane sources at"
4,4.5,4.5.2,summary,"The methane landscape within TYNDP 2024 scenarios projects a significant decline in traditional indigenous natural gas production, culminating at zero by mid-century (Figure 32). This shift is reflected across all outlined paths—DE and GA exhibit more aggressive targets with respective reductions of 47% for DE and 40% for GA from a baseline established in the National Trends+ scenario circa 2030.

Transitioning to renewable sources, indigenous methane production—encompassed by biomethane and synthetic alternatives derived through electrolysis—varies according to each narrative's projections (Figure 32). The National Trends+ trajectory foresees a gradual amplification of biomethane output, complementing the limited generation capacity anticipated from electrically produced methane. Collectively, these renewable sources are projected to adequately fulfill declining conventional gas supply demands by 2050.

Biomethane emerges as a cornerstone in curbing carbon emissions within this evolving energy matrix; it is identified as the principal driver for decarbonizing methane supplies across both deviation scenarios (Figure 32). To achieve zero-emission status by mid-century, synthetic methane also gains importance due to its ability to bridge supply shortfalls and facilitate full carbon neutrality.

By this juncture in the timeline—specifically within Distributed Energy's framework (DE) scenario—indigenous renewable gas output is anticipated at 920 TWh by 2050, with synthetic methane contributing a slightly higher share compared to its Global Ambition counterpart. Herein lies approximately 635 TWh of biomethane's contribution in the same year (Figure 32).

The landscape shifts as we delve into renewable methane sources such as biomethane, which are poised to play a pivotal role in our energy transition efforts. Herein lies their significance: not only do they contribute substantially toward mitigating emissions—indeed, both deviation scenarios rely on them heavily for decarbonization of the methane supply chain—but also synthetic methane emerges as an innovative complement that holds promise in achieving carbon neutrality by mid-century.

By 2050's horizon, projections indicate a complete phasing out of imports to zero for all scenarios considered; however, there is notable variability between them with respect to indigenous production levels and the role played by synthetic methane in bridging supply gaps: DE scenario anticipates around 920 TWh from renewable sources whereas Global Ambition forecasts a more robust portfolio of approximately 1078 TWh. Biomethane, while less dominant than its counterparts under the Distributed Energy model (circa 635 TWh by year-end), is still integral to sustaining energy demands with imports reaching an all-time low in this scenario—nonzero natural gas expectations are absent from these projections.

The Global Ambition narrative, particularly relevant for the EU's integration into a comprehensive global transition framework, illustrates high decarbonization ambitions alongside strategic market positioning to support renewable and decarbonized methane (1078 TWh by 2050). Coupled with efficiency enhancements, this scenario envisions significant declines in imports—"

By 2040 relative to baseline projections from National Trends+ (Nt+), methane output will see significant reductions: a decrease of approximately one third for the DE scenario and around forty percent for both Distributed Energy (DE) and Global Ambition scenarios. This shift reflects Austria's commitment towards ambitious decarbonization efforts, with synthetic gas production emerging as an integral component in achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 alongside renewable biomethane initiatives.  
The DE scenario anticipates a moderate increase in indigenous bio-based methane and limited use of electrolytic synthesis, while the Global Ambition (GA) strategy emphasizes robust growth for both these sources to fulfill rising demand without reliance on imports or conventional gas by 2050.

By comparing levels in DE against GA scenarios—wherein we see reductions upwards of 47% and 40%, respectively, as opposed to a more moderate decrease observed within National Trends+ (31%)—the urgency for renewable methane alternatives is underscored.
Biomethane emerges as an indispensable contributor in the decarbonization of our energy mix; it will serve predominantly across DE and GA scenarios, wherein its role becomes integral to achieving a carbon-neutral future by 2050. Synthetic methane production through electrolysis also gains traction within these models as an essential component in meeting the ambitious decarbonization targets of both deviation pathways.

By the year 2040, there is an anticipated reduction in methane output of approximately 31%, with more aggressive targets set for scenarios DE and GA at reductions nearing 47% and 40%, respectively.

Diverse pathways to renewable sources such as biomethane are charted within each scenario, reflecting distinct strategic objectives concerning green energy production expansion. The National Trends+ model predicts a progressive increase in the generation of biomethane over time and suggests that synthetic methane will remain relatively untapped until later stages due to current technological constraints.

Renewable gases, collectively generated from both sources—biomethane leading as a primary contributor for decarbonization efforts in all scenarios—are projected to offset the decline of traditional natural gas supplies fully by mid-century. This strategic reliance on renewables is pivotal: biomethane emerges not only essential but instrumental, driving down greenhouse emissions and supporting overall methane supply decarbonization goals for both deviation scenarios—DE (Deviation) and GA (Ambitious).

Synthetic production of methane plays a complementary role in this transition. By 2050, synthetics are expected to be pivotal not just supplementing but also fulfilling the burgeoning demand for carbon-neutral energy sources as indigenous supplies dwindle entirely by that year under both scenarios DE and GA models—this is a testament to their growing significance in our shift towards sustainable methane production.

Focusing on specifics, within Bulgaria's context (Country: Bulgaristan), the Distributed Energy scenario predicts 920 TWh of renewably-derived and decarbonized methane by 2050 with a slightly elevated synthetic output relative to GA.

Meanwhile, more ambitious targets are set under Deviation and Global Ambition scenarios with reductions reaching 47% and 40%, respectively by that same year-end markpoint.

Diverse renewable methane sources—biomethane alongside synthetic alternatives produced via electrolysis—are integral to these projections, aligning production levels according to each scenario's narrative framework. National Trends+ predicts a growth in biomethane utilization and modest expansion of electrically derived methane supply chains throughout the coming decades while maintaining overall equilibrium between diminishing conventional gas output and escalating renewable contributions by 2050, effectively achieving zero import dependency.

Biomethane's critical contribution to this green transition underscores its predominant role in offsetting methane supply deficits within both deviation scenarios; it serves as a cornerstone for the EU’s decarbonisation endeavors by 2050, with synthetic gas emerging alongside biomethane as an essential complementary resource.

The examination of methane supply within the three main scenarios delineated by the Technology Readiness Pathways (TYNDP) 2024 reveals a unified trajectory towards complete cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production, targeted for zero emissions in the year 2050. By contrasting with baseline projections from National Trends+ by 2030 levels, we observe significant reductions: DE scenario predicts a sharp decrease to -47%, while GA strategy shows an even more ambitious target of -40% in methane output come 2040.

Diversity within the renewable energy framework is evident across these scenarios; indigenous sources such as biomethane and synthetic gas through electrolysis are scaled variably, aligning with each scenario's strategic narrative for decarbonization efforts. The National Trends+ forecast reveals a progressive augmentation of renewable methane production in tandem with limited reliance on traditional methodologies due to the emergence and scalability potential within synthetic gas options, which together culminate into an equilibrium that satisfies declining conventional supply demands by 2050.

**Biomethane's Pivotal Role: A Cornerstone for Renewable Methane Supply Chains**  
The role of biomethane stands out as a cornerstone within the renewable methane landscape, serving not only to facilitate decarbonization but also emerging preeminently in both deviation scenarios. It is here that synthetic gas demonstrates its complementary function—addressing supply deficits and propelling us towards an ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050 through strategically planned production enhancements, notably within the Global Ambition framework where it accounts for a substantial volume (approximately -1634 TWh).

The Distributed Energy scenario sketches out an environment of reduced indigenous",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Grid Flows,"In Figure 32, we observe a comprehensive analysis of methane provision within TYNDP 2024 scenarios for the EU member states, with particular emphasis on Czech Republic dynamics. By mid-century (2050), all outlined strategies converge towards an ambitious target: halting conventional indigenous natural gas production entirely by that year's end.

As we proceed to 2040—a critical decade for transformative change—there is a significant shift in methane output, with the National Trends+ scenario indicating upwards of a 31% reduction from baseline levels set at 2030; this contrasts markedly against more aggressive reductions posited by DE (47%) and GA scenarios.

The landscape for renewable methane sources, such as biomethane—which underscores its importance in the decarbonization trajectory of natural gas supply —and synthetic alternatives generated through electrolysis processes is diverse across these frameworks. Notably, while DE and GA scenarios accentuate substantial investments into renewable methane production to fulfill their zero-emission objectives by 2050, the National Trends+ scenario underscores a gradual uptick in biomethane usage that complements its modest synthetic counterpart.

Crucially, our analysis reveals an imminent phaseout of methane imports across all scenarios—culminating at zero by 2050 to align with stringent decarbonization mandates. In the Distributed Energy scenario specifically, renewable and sustainably produced indigenous biomethane is projected modestly yet meaningfully contributing approximately 635 TWh of supply in that same year—marking a significant pivot from reliance on imported fuels to fostering self-sufficiency.

The Global Ambition scenario takes the lead, championing both robust decarbonization efforts and strategic market integration for renewable methane imports (predicted at 1078 TWh by midpoint of century). This is complemented by a pronounced decrease in traditional natural gas import reliance—down to nil figures post-2050, thanks largely to enhanced energy efficiency measures.

Figure 32 illustrates methane supply dynamics across three scenarios within TYNDP 2024, emphasizing a concerted effort to curb conventional natural gas production by the mid-century target of zero emissions in 2050. By this benchmark year, we anticipate substantial reductions from current levels—31% below National Trends+ projections for DE and GA scenarios at approximately 47%, respectively.
In alignment with these ambitious targets, biomethane production is poised to ascend gradually as a pivotal renewable methane source in all narratives while the role of synthetic gases through electrolysis will be amplified—particularly within DE and GA scenarios.
Biomethane emerges not only as an essential component but also as the linchpin for decarbonizing our energy portfolio, with its contributions to methane supply outstripping those of synthetic alternatives in both deviation pathways. Concurrently, strategic deployment and expansion of synthetic gas technology are critical milestones on this journey toward achieving carbon neutrality by 2050—a goal that remains unattainable without substantial imports being phased into obsolescence within the same timeframe in both scenarios under scrutiny.
In analyzing specific national contexts, such as Germany's energy landscape, it becomes evident how localized strategies like Distributed Energy are calibrated to mitigate reliance on indigenous production of renewable and decarbonised methane—projected at 920 TWh by the year 2050. Here synthetic gas contributions show modest gains, while biomethane secures a significant position but is not as dominant when juxtaposed with broader scenarios like Global Ambition which forecasts an integrated approach to energy transition and import reductions down to zero in alignment with EU objectives by 2050.

In examining methane supply under three distinct Technology, Yields & Diversification Pathways (TYNDP) scenarios through Figure 32, a consistent decline in conventional indigenous natural gas production is observed across all pathways. By the year 2050, this trend culminates with zero-production levels. In contrast to National Trends+ by 2040, there's an anticipated reduction of methane output by approximately 31%. The DE (Deep Emission Reduction) and GA (Global Ambition for Energy Transformation) scenarios underscore more aggressive targets with reductions reaching up to a significant 47% in the former, paralleling efforts towards ambitious decarbonization.

The TYNDP frameworks delineate varying trajectories of indigenous renewable methane production—encompassing biomethane and synthetic variants generated via electrolysis technologies —tethered to each scenario's unique narrative framework, suggesting a shift towards sustainable energy sources.

National Trends+ predicts an augmentation of the country’s contribution from renewables within its methane supply by 2050, with biomethane emerging as pivotal in this decarbonization endeavor—a consistent theme across scenarios that underscores a strategic pivot towards lower carbon fuel sources.

Synthetic methane production is accentuated within the GA scenario due to its indispensable role for achieving zero-carbon targets, presenting itself as an innovative supplementary source essential in offsetting conventional supply deficits and enabling a transition towards net neutrality by 2050.

Regarding imports of natural gas methane, both scenarios project complete cessation by the year 2050—a testament to Germany's commitment toward energy self-sufficiency aligned with stringent environmental benchmarks set forth in national policy frameworks and international agreements aimed at mitigating climate change.

By this mid-century milestone, conventional indigenous natural gas production is projected to cease entirely across all models—a testament to Denmark's commitment to a sustainable future.

In comparison against the National Trends+ baseline for 2030 levels by 2040, methane output shows significant contraction; DE scenario projections indicate an ambitious reduction of up to 47%, while GA scenarios target reductions between 40% and 47%. Such shifts underscore the critical role biomethane will play in replacing conventional gas supplies. The anticipated growth trajectory for synthetic methane production, primarily through electrolysis technologies under these ambitious plans—though modest relative to other renewables—paves a path toward carbon neutrality by mid-century with zero imports expected post 2050 milestone.

Denmark's energy landscape is poised for transformation as it navigates through scenarios like Distributed Energy, which anticipates lower levels of indigenous production and relies more on synthetic methane to meet demands—approximately 920 TWh in the year 2050. The Global Ambition scenario presents a contrasting vision with substantial biomethane utilization (635 TWh) alongside robust growth for both renewable and decarbonized gas production, reaching an estimated total of over 1078 TWh by mid-century—all without reliance on natural methane imports or emissions.

Figure DETO: Denmark's Methane Supply Projections to 2050 highlight the strategic pivot away from traditional fossil fuels and towards a diverse portfolio of renewable sources, including biomethane—a linchpin in achieving decarbonization targets. Moreover, energy efficiency measures are projected to further diminish methane imports by half come 2040 under the Global Ambition scenario while ensuring an unbroken supply chain",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Grid Flows,"Denmark's energy landscape is poised to undergo a transformative shift within TYNDP 2024, as illustrated in Figure 32 detailing methane supply projections across diverse scenarios up to 2050. Conventional natural gas production faces an imminent cessation by this midpoint of the century; consequently, a significant reduction is anticipated—a sharp decline from baseline levels observed in National Trends+ for 2030 with projections indicating near-zero indigenous methane output.

The pursuit towards decarbonization intensifies as scenarios DE and GA propose more aggressive cuts, envisioning a reduction of up to 47% by the end of this period in scenario D and nearly half that figure for GA at approximately 40%. The emphasis shifts markedly from conventional sources towards indigenous renewable methane solutions like biomethane.

Biomethane emerges as a cornerstone within these narratives, with its potential to spearhead the decarbonization of Denmark's energy portfolio being both substantial and pivotal in deviant scenarios where synthetic alternatives also play an increasingly integral role by 2050.

By this future date, all import levels are projected at zero across TYNDP 2024 frameworks—highlighting a self-sufficient methane supply structure within Denmark's borders. The Distributed Energy scenario forecasts lower indigenous production of renewable and decarbonized gases by the year 2050, contrasted with its more ambitious counterparts which envisage higher synthetic gas outputs—specifically around 285 TWh for DE compared to approximately 635 TWh from biomethane sources.

The Global Ambition scenario embodies a dual commitment: achieving high decarbonization rates while simultaneously expanding accessibility through global renewable methane markets, reaching an estimated supply of around 1078 TWh by the target year and further reducing reliance on imports to zero.

4,4.5,4.5.3,Estonia,"Within Figure 32, we observe a detailed projection of methane availability under three distinct pathways outlined in TYNDP (Targeting Year Nexus for Decarbonization Plan) scenarios by 2050: National Trends+ and two deviation paths—Distributed Energy and Global Ambition. A consistent trend emerges across all projections, which is a significant diminishment of conventional indigenous natural gas production to zero within the same timeframe due to declining reserves or shifts in policy emphasis towards sustainable alternatives.

By 2040—a pivotal decade marking our decarbonization efforts—the National Trends+ scenario forecasts a notable reduction of methane output by approximately 31% compared to its benchmark established at the end of this century's first quarter (2030). The deviation scenarios present even more ambitious targets; DE outlines an aspirational cutback reaching nearly half, whereas GA proposes substantial reductions around a third.

The renewable methane segment—comprising biomethane and synthetic variants produced via electrolysis—varyingly align with each scenario's narrative framework while collectively contributing to the overarching decarbonization strategy for our energy infrastructure. The National Trends+ model predicts a steady ascent in renewable methane, particularly biomethane; however, synthetic production is capped at current technology levels and remains relatively modest by comparison.

Biogas emerges not only as an indispensable component within the tapestry of our decarbonization efforts but also serves to significantly mitigate methane's carbon footprint across both deviation scenarios, underscoring its central role in transition strategies aimed at achieving a net-zero emissions future.

By 2050—a target year often cited for the completion of our decarbonization commitments within these projections—the import levels are projected to cease entirely across all scenarios, signifying self-sufficiency and sustainable energy autonomy at its zenith. The Distributed Energy scenario portrays a lower baseline renewable methane output but achieves this without reliance on imported natural gas by 20",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Grid Flows,"In Figure 32, we analyze methane provision across three pivotal TYNDP 2024 scenarios with a unified vision of zero conventional indigenous natural gas production by 2050. By this year, there is an anticipated reduction in total methane output—by approximately one-third compared to the National Trends+ baseline for 2030 under DE and GA strategies with reductions reaching 47% and 40%, respectively.
The composition of renewable sources within these scenarios demonstrates a nuanced approach: biomethane emerges as an indispensable element in the decarbonization process, while synthetic methane production is optimized through electrolysis techniques to complement supply requirements for carbon neutrality by mid-century.
By 2050, both scenarios aim at eliminating import levels of natural gas entirely—a testament to their commitment towards a sustainable future. The Distributed Energy scenario forecasts renewed emphasis on biomethane (635 TWh) and moderated reliance on synthetic methane production (285 TWh), with minimal imports anticipated in 2040, heralding the shift towards self-sufficiency.
Conversely, Global Ambition champions a more interconnected approach by fostering high decarbonization standards alongside robust access to global markets for renewable methane (1078 TWh projected). Strategic energy efficiency initiatives are set forth with the objective of diminishing import quantities from 1119 TWh in anticipation of a zero-import status by 2050.

4,4.5,4.5.3,Spain,"In examining Figure 32, we observe a comprehensive depiction of methane provision across three TYNDP 2024 scenarios with an emphasis on sustainability and decarbonization targets by mid-century (2050). Conventional indigenous natural gas production is projected to cease entirely, reflecting a unified trajectory towards zero emissions. By the year 2040, there will be substantial reductions in methane output—31% below National Trends+ baseline levels for conventional sources; however, scenarios DE and GA propose more aggressive cuts of 47% (DE) and a significant reduction to only 40%.

Diversification into indigenous renewable forms such as biomethane—and synthetic methane via electrolytic processes—is pivotal. The National Trends+ scenario illustrates an upward trend in the adoption of these green alternatives, which are anticipated to adequately offset diminishing conventional production by 2050 and drive substantial decarbonization within our methane supply chain.

The role biomethane plays cannot be overstated as it becomes a linchpin for reducing emissions from the existing natural gas framework, while synthetic routes are indispensable in bridging gaps toward full carbon neutrality by 2050. This strategic pivot is reflected across all scenarios with import levels set to zero come mid-century, ensuring alignment with ambitious climate goals.

Within the Distributed Energy scenario specifically, renewable and decarbonized methane production stands at approximately 920 TWh by 2050—a testament to its contribution towards a sustainable future despite being less dominant than in other scenarios where synthetic alternatives are more heavily leveraged (~635 TWh for biomethane, ~285 TWh for synthetics). Notably, this scenario achieves the lowest reliance on imports by 2040 and eliminates natural gas requirements entirely come 2050.

By the year 2050, conventional indigenous natural gas production is predicted to reach zero across all examined scenarios—a testament to our collective commitment towards sustainability goals.

By comparing projections up until 2040 with baseline National Trends+ levels for that same period in the past decade (specifically, a reduction of methane production by approximately one-third), we see distinct differences among scenarios: DE scenario forecasts an ambitious decrease exceeding two-fifths; GA achieves roughly forty percent lower output.

Renewable and decarbonized sources like biomethane gain prominence within each narrative, reflective of their pivotal role in the energy sector's transition to greener alternatives. Synthetic methane also emerges as a vital contributor—its production amplifies considerably with scenarios that demand higher levels of carbon neutrality by 2050 and supports an expanding portfolio for decarbonized gas supplies, thereby ensuring energy security in the face of declining natural resources.

Importantly, all models converge on a shared target: nullifying methane imports to zero well ahead of mid-century deadlines—a critical objective that underscores our dedication towards environmental stewardship and responsible resource management within Spain's energy landscape. 

Specifically examining the Distributed Energy scenario, we see modest indigenous renewable output totaling nearly a thousand terawatt hours (TWh) by mid-century—a figure that underscores localized sustainability efforts and reliance on domestic resources amidst broader market integration.

By mid-century (2050), all projections predict the cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production due to sustained decline trends, setting a benchmark year zero in this context.

Between now and 2040—the pivotal decade for policy intervention—a significant contraction is projected: national methane output will diminish by approximately one-third relative to the baseline National Trends+ scenario established for 2030, with deviation scenarios DE (downsizing reduced further) and GA presenting more aggressive targets at reductions of 47% and 40%, respectively.

Diversification strategies emerge as a focal point within this landscape; the production portfolio pivots towards indigenous renewable methane, encompassed by biomethane—a critical decarbonization vector in both deviation scenarios—and synthetic alternatives derived from electrolytic processes. By 2050, these sustainably produced gases are anticipated to fully offset the downturn of conventional sources and satisfy methane demand within EU borders autonomously.

In particular attention is given to biomethane's centrality in decarbonizing our energy supply chain; it stands as a cornerstone for achieving substantial emission cutbacks, overshadowing synthetic gas production which assumes an augmented yet supportive role toward attaining net-zero emissions by the year 2050.

The methane supply landscape is diversified, reflecting a spectrum of renewable sources such as biomethane. The National Trends+ scenario predicts an upward trajectory in the production volume for this type of renewable gas over time; however, synthetic methane derived from electrolytic processes represents only marginal quantities within our projections. Despite these variances across scenarios, it is projected that a comprehensive increase in renewable gases will adequately offset reductions seen with conventional natural gas reserves and contribute to the overall decarbonization effort of methane supply systems by 2050 for France.

Central to this transition are biomethane initiatives, which emerge as a cornerstone in mitigating carbon emissions associated with current energy practices within both DEviation scenarios - achieving near-zero levels thereof post-2050. Synthetic methane also figures prominently due to its critical role in bolstering supply alongside renewable alternatives, aimed at realizing a net zero footprint by mid-century milestones for the nation's energy portfolio.

All trajectories converge on a pivotal point: by 2050, conventional indigenous natural gas production is expected to cease entirely—a testament to our collective commitment towards sustainability and decarbonization goals.

By the year 2040, we anticipate an overall reduction in methane output of approximately 31% relative to National Trends+ benchmarks set for a 2030 outlook; however, this figure climbs with ambition—reaching reductions upwards of 47% and 40%, as delineated within the DE (Distributed Energy) and GA (Global Ambition), respectively.

The landscape is markedly diversified in terms of indigenous renewable methane production, which includes both biomethane derived from organic waste streams and synthetic variants produced via electrochemical processes such as hydrogen-to-methane conversion. In alignment with our environmental objectives, these alternative sources are poised to rise significantly in the coming decades, ensuring a robust replacement for conventional gas supplies that will support Europe's transition towards carbon neutrality by mid-century—a target firmly established within both deviation scenarios presented herein.

With an emphasis on biomethane as one of our cornerstone renewable resources, its pivotal role in the decarbonization pathway cannot be overstated; it serves not only to replace conventional gas supplies but also stands at the forefront among all sources for methane replacement. Simultaneously, synthetic methane emerges as an indispensable ally—its strategic deployment within our energy portfolio will help bridge gaps in supply and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 through its integration with advanced production technologies that are currently being scaled up to meet this demand.

In alignment with each scenario's tailored narrative framework, there is a marked reduction in methane output by approximately one-third compared to National Trends+ benchmark levels set for 2040; the Distributed Energy and Global Ambition approaches propose even more substantial declines of roughly 47% and 40%, respectively.

Amidst these shifts, renewable sources such as biomethane emerge prominently within each scenario's strategy—signifying their critical role in achieving decarbonization targets for methane supply by mid-century (2050). Notably, synthetic methane production is set to expand significantly under the Global Ambition pathway as a key component of carbon neutrality efforts.

By 2040 and extending through to zero imports in all scenarios come 2050, we observe an evolution towards self-sufficiency with respect to indigenous methane production—a testament to the EU's progressive energy transition underpinned by sustainable practices.

In particular regard to Greece: The Distributed Energy scenario foresees a modest rise in renewables, resulting in 920 TWh of locally produced and decarbonized methane resources available annually come the year 2050; concurrently synthetic production is anticipated at around 285 TWh. Meanwhile, biomethane's contribution stands robust albeit slightly overshadowed by these figures—amounting to roughly half of this renewable output (635 TWh).

Similarly ambitious cuts are anticipated through Green Action Agenda (GA) initiatives, aiming at a reduction by nearly half in indigenously produced methane levels compared to our current trajectory outlined for National Trends+.

The renewable and decarbonized sources of biomethane emerge as critical components within these scenarios; they are set on an upward trend, particularly under the Global Ambition scenario which underscores a comprehensive strategy combining rigorous greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction with strategic market accessibility for renewable and decarbonized methane.

In 2050 projections within Hungary's contextual framework, both the DE and GA scenarios showcase negligible levels of biomethane imports — zero in fact – underscoring a substantial reliance on indigenous production alongside strategic integration with renewable energy sources. The Distributed Energy scenario indicates slightly higher synthetic methane outputs to compensate for lowered domestic supplies, while also relying heavily upon imported decarbonized biomethane and minimal natural gas imports by 2050's end target of zero emissions contributions from conventional gases.

The Global Ambition scenario illustrates a robust framework where energy efficiency measures effectively diminish methane import requirements to the lowest amongst all scenarios, achieving complete decarbonization in Hungary’s future supply chain by 2050 through comprehensive global and market diversification efforts for renewable gas resources.

Figure 32 illustrates the anticipated trajectory of methane supply within three distinct scenarios under TYNDP 2024. Each scenario projects a unified decline in conventional indigenous natural gas production, culminating at zero by mid-century (2050). By this pivotal year—specifically the baseline period of 2040 compared to National Trends+ established for 2030—there is an anticipated reduction ranging from a moderate decrease in conventional methane production scenarios, down by approximately 31%, and more ambitious reductions reaching upwards of 47% under the Distributed Energy (DE) scenario. Similarly, renewable synthetic gas accounts for growth with projections indicating that these sources will effectively bridge supply gaps as traditional natural gas dwindles to cessation by our target year.

Renewable methane—comprising biomethane and synthetically produced forms such as those derived from electrolysis processes — is earmarked for strategic augmentation within these scenarios, reflecting tailored narratives aligned with ambitious decarbonization objectives. The role of biomethane emerges prominently in this context; it represents a cornerstone strategy to achieve significant reductions across all considered pathways and sustains its position as the primary driver for methane supply de-carbonisation efforts, aiming towards full carbon neutrality by 2050.

The strategic importation of nonrenewable natural gas is slated toward complete elimination in line with these scenarios' decarbonization goals; a bold stance that underscores the transition to sustainable energy sources as imperative for Italy and its partners within Europe, setting benchmarks aimed at global market integration.

In scenarios designated as DE and GA, we witness more pronounced ambitions with a reduction targeting nearly half (47%) in scenario Delta Energy and an even greater contraction of about one-fifth (40%), respectively.

Renewable methane sources are not static; they evolve within these scenarios reflective of their distinct narrative frameworks, as evidenced by the divergent growth trajectories for biomethane production and synthetic alternatives derived from electrolysis processes—with a noted emphasis on latter's limited expansion. Notably, renewable gases collectively serve to bridge methane supply deficits arising from conventional gas reductions, aligning with overarching decarbonization strategies within both deviation scenarios presented herein.

Biomethane stands out as a pivotal element in the transition of our energy matrix towards sustainability; it is instrumental to achieving substantial methane supply de-carbonization across these varied pathways, positioning itself at the forefront alongside synthetic methane solutions which are increasingly recognized for their potential role in reaching full carbon neutrality by 2050.

The envisaged trajectory is clear: import levels will be recalibrated to zero come mid-century across all scenarios, underscoring a strategic pivot away from reliance on external methane sources and towards self-sustaining renewable alternatives within the Lithuanian context—a microcosm of Europe's broader energy transformation ambitions.

In particular attention should be given to Scenario Distributed Energy (DE), where indigenous production capacity for both decarbonized methane variants is projected at 920 TWh by the year 2050, with synthetic sources contributing a not",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Grid Flows,"In Figure 32, we observe a comprehensive analysis of methane provision across various TYNDP (Tenth Year National Energy and Climate Plan) scenarios for Lithuania up to 2050. By this mid-century target date, it is projected that conventional indigenous natural gas production will cease entirely in all considered pathways. Notably, by the year 2040—two decades prior to our zero emissions goal—the National Trends+ scenario demonstrates a significant reduction of approximately 31% from its baseline methane output established for that same timeframe within DE and GA (Distributed Energy) scenarios. The former aspires an even more ambitious cut, at around 47%, while the latter seeks to achieve roughly half this figure with a targeted reduction of about 20%.

This downward trend in traditional methane production is being counterbalanced by burgeoning renewable alternatives such as biomethane and synthetic gas. The growth trajectory for these sources reflects the tailored objectives within each scenario, with National Trends+ envisioning a steady climb specifically focused on expanding its stock of bio-derived methane over time alongside modest levels of electrolytically produced synfuels.

Biomethane emerges as an indispensable element in the shift towards more sustainable energy sources, serving to substantially diminish our carbon footprint within both DE and GA scenarios by 2050—where it fulfills a critical role for decarbonization efforts. Its complementary counterpart is synthetic methane; despite its lesser prominence in the near term compared to biomethane, this innovative fuel type becomes crucial as we edge closer towards our net-zero ambitions by midcentury—especially within scenarios demanding higher decarbonization rates.

By 2050, Lithuania is set on a path where methane import levels are poised to reach nullity across all examined strategies in the TYNDP framework. The Distributed Energy scenario illustrates particularly robust bio-based production—aiming for an estimated output of approximately 635 Terawatt hours (TWh) by this date, which remains central despite its"
4,4.5,4.5.3,Luxembourg,"In Figure 32, an analysis of methane provision across three distinct TYNDP 2024 scenarios is presented; each scenario projects a convergence toward complete cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas by mid-century (2050). By the year 2040, there exists a notable decline in traditional production metrics—31% less methane output compared to National Trends+ benchmarks established for 2030. The DE and GA scenarios propose more ambitious targets with reductions of up to 47% and 40%, respectively.

The landscape of renewable indigenous gas production, encompassing both biomethane and synthetic methane variants (including those produced via electrolysis), diverges according to each scenario's narrative framework. Notably, the National Trends+ trajectory anticipates a gradual upsurge in renewable gas output over time—sufficient not only for offsetting conventional natural declines but also progressively diminishing import reliance by 2050 through zero imports as depicted below:
- Biomethane emerges prominently within the decarbonization strategy of methane supply, serving predominantly in both deviation scenarios. Synthetic gas technologies are instrumental for supplementary needs and achieving carbon neutrality objectives by 2050.
  
In alignment with each scenario's ambition levels:
- Distributed Energy focuses on localized renewable production, projecting a total of approximately 920 TWh in indigenous output for the year 2050—with synthetic gas contributions marginally surpassed by biomethane at around 635 TWh. Importation levels are set to reach their nadir and ultimately cease entirely, reflecting a self-reliance paradigm shift in methane sourcing strategies for the year under consideration (2040).
  
Conversely:
- Global Ambition envisions an integrated approach that marries high decarbonization with robust international trade networks—envisioned at 1078 TWh by midpoint of century. The scenario further reduces methane import dependency through comprehensive energy efficiency measures, reaching zero imports for the same year",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Grid Flows,"In Figure 32, we examine methane sources within all three scenarios of TYNDP 2024 for EU member states such as Luxembourg: a clear trajectory towards cessation by 2050 is observed in conventional natural gas production. By the year 2040, there will be substantial reductions—31% from National Trends+ baseline levels and more ambitious cuts of up to 47% or even beyond for scenarios DE and GA respectively.

Diverse pathways emerge in indigenous renewable methane production: biomethane sees a pronounced growth trajectory, while synthetic methods are less prevalent but critical nonetheless. The collective output of these green gas options adequately offsets the declining trends observed within fossil-based natural gas supplies and paves an essential route towards methanation decarbonization across both deviation scenarios analyzed herein.

Biomethane stands out as a cornerstone in this transition, dominating renewable energy contributions to our green grid by 2050—a testament to its versatility and efficacy within the context of methanation decarbonization strategies that span both DEviation scenarios. In tandem with synthetic alternatives' emerging importance for achieving carbon neutrality, a zero-import threshold is established in our sustainable vision by 2050—a stark contrast to earlier projections and indicative of the transformative potential within energy transitions at hand.

The Distributed Energy scenario underscores reduced indigenous production capacity for renewables compared with its counterparts, notching upwards only a modest figure in TWh by 2050—635 to be precise; yet synthetic methane contributions are more robust relative to the Global Ambition narrative. This scenario uniquely positions itself as one leaner on natural gas imports well into the future, culminating at zero levels come mid-century and underscoring a shift towards self-sustaining energy networks that bolster resilience across Europe's diverse landscape of national infrastructures.

Conversely, Global Ambition paints an ambitious canvas: high decarbonization coupled with robust market accessibility for renewable methane"
4,4.5,4.5.3,Latvia,"The forthcoming energy scenarios delineate a trajectory wherein conventional indigenous natural gas production is projected to cease by mid-century (2050). In alignment with this trend, there exists an anticipated reduction of methane output—by approximately 31% in the National Trends+ scenario and reaching more aggressive targets at upwards of 47% for both Distributed Energy (DE) and Global Ambition scenarios.

Central to these projections is a diversification strategy that encompasses renewable methane sources such as biomethane, alongside the burgeoning sector of synthetic methane production—primarily driven by electrolysis technologies. This strategic pivot ensures an adequate compensatory volume to offset conventional natural gas declines and sets a foundation for achieving carbon neutrality goals by 2050.

Within this framework, biomethane emerges as the cornerstone of renewable methane supply—its significant role underscored in both deviation scenarios (DE & Global Ambition). Meanwhile, synthetic alternatives are positioned to address residual shortfalls and facilitate a comprehensive shift toward carbon-neutral energy systems.

A zero import benchmark is established for 2050 across all examined models—reflecting an ambitious yet achievable target in the wake of sustained decarbonisation efforts. Notably, Latvia's Distributed Energy scenario portrays a modest indigenous output at approximately 920 TWh by that date; however, it underscores synthetic methane production as slightly more robust compared to Global Ambition—at an estimated volume of around 285 TWh. Biomethane's contribution is significant but not dominant within this scenario, reaching close to 635 TWh in the same timeframe and signaling a reduced dependency on imports by mid-century.

In contrast, Global Ambition illustrates an integration strategy that harnesses high decarbonisation levels while simultaneously securing accessibility to globally distributed renewable methane markets—predictions indicate 1078 TWh of supply in the year 2050 with a notable reduction in imports due to enhanced energy efficiency measures. This scenario ultimately aspires for complete",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Grid Flows,"The methane landscape within all three scenarios of TYNDP 2024 exhibits a consistent trajectory towards cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production by mid-century, specifically zeroing out in 2050 as depicted in Figure 32. By the year 2040, there is an anticipated decline to approximately one third below National Trends+ projections made for 2030 levels of methane output – a stark contrast with DE and GA scenarios that set forth more ambitious targets: reductions reaching upwards of forty percent in both.

In alignment with their respective strategic narratives, the production volumes of indigenous renewable sources such as biomethane are projected to vary among these futures; however, all recognize its critical role within methane supply sustainability and decarbonization efforts across scenarios including deviation pathways. The National Trends+ scenario underscores a progressive upsurge in the production of this renewable source over time while synthetic options through electrolysis are marked as limited contributors to overall volumes, ensuring sufficient replacement for diminishing conventional gas supplies with an eye on maintaining balance within Europe's energy matrix.

The pivotal role played by biomethane in the transition of methane supply towards greener alternatives is highlighted; it emerges not only as a major player but also as the predominant agent for decarbonizing this essential commodity across both deviation scenarios, setting an indispensable course toward zero-emission targets by 2050. Synthetic methane production surfaces in parallel importance – recognized as instrumental to fulfilling supply demands and achieving carbon neutrality ambitions within the same timeframe.

The import landscape undergoes a complete transformation, with projections indicating an outright cessation by 2050 for all scenarios involved; this marks a significant milestone in Europe's journey toward energy sovereignty and reduced dependence on fossil fuel imports – underscored particularly within the Distributed Energy scenario where indigenous production is noted to be lower at around 920 TWh by its midpoint of projection, with synthetic methane contributing a slightly higher share compared against GA scenarios.

4,4.5,4.5.3,Netherlands,"The provided analysis of methane dynamics within various TYNDP scenarios underscores a critical shift towards sustainable energy sources by mid-century, specifically targeting zero conventional natural gas production in line with European Union objectives for decarbonization and renewable integration. In the Distributed Energy scenario, indigenous biomethane generation is projected to be 920 terawatt-hours (TWh) annually by 2050—an essential yet comparatively modest contributor amidst larger synthetic methane and bioenergy production figures. Synthetic alternatives are set to become increasingly significant, with an anticipated output of approximately 285 TWh in the same year for this scenario alone, reflecting a strategic pivot towards achieving carbon neutrality goals by that milestone.

Conversely, Global Ambition represents ambitious decarbonization efforts coupled with market diversification aspirations—achieving an impressive renewable methane supply of 1078 TWh in the same timeframe and reducing imports substantially to nullity by 2050. By that period, energy efficiency measures are expected to further diminish import dependencies down to a negligible figure as well (1119 TWh). This scenario illustrates not just an internal transition within Europe's methane supply but also the potential for establishing robust global trade routes in renewable and decarbonized gases.
 
These scenarios demonstrate varied trajectories, with synthetic gas production emerging as a critical component to fulfill future energy demands while aligning closely with environmental targets set by policy-makers across different sectors—ranging from national governance entities like the Netherlands to international collaborations and non-governmental organizations. The overarching narrative is clear: achieving net zero methane emissions necessitates a substantial scale up in renewable gas production, with biomethane serving as an indispensable bridge towards this new energy paradigm by 2050 across all considered scenarios.
",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Grid Flows,"Within Figure 32, we delineate methane provision across three distinctive scenarios within TYNDP 2024 framework; each scenario anticipates a convergence towards zero conventional indigenous natural gas production by approximately 2050. By the year 2040, there is an estimated contraction of about 31% in methane yield relative to National Trends+ benchmarks set for 2030—with divergent targets at 47% and 40% reductions under DE (Distributed Energy) and GA (Global Ambition), respectively.

The renewable segment, inclusive of biomethane alongside synthetic methane derived through electrolysis processes, exhibits variable output tailored to the scenario's narrative directionality. Notably, National Trends+ envisions a progressively augmented contribution from biomethane and anticipates modest growth in production capacity for its counterpart—synthetic methane via hydrogen electrolytic methods by 2050 stands as an essential component to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.

In the realm of decarbonisation, biomethane emerges prominently within both deviation scenarios; it is deemed fundamental for transitioning methane supply towards sustainability goals and achieving near zero imprints by mid-century—mirrored in figures presented herewith. Synthetic alternatives are envisioned as a critical supplementary force, steering the energy system closer to carbon neutrality targets set forth within 2050 timelines across scenarios examined.

The reduction trajectory for methane imports is unilateral—culminating in null figures by 2050 under all considered strategies; this underscores a pivotal transition towards self-reliance and renewable energy sourcing within the EU's ambitious environmental agenda.

Delving deeper into scenario specificity, Distributed Energy outlines an anticipated decline in indigenous production of both biomethane (circa 635 TWh by 2050) and decarbonised methane sources when juxtaposed against Global Ambition's projected figures. This scenario posits a lower reliance on imports"
4,4.5,4.5.3,Poland,"The methane landscape within all TYNDP 2024 scenarios reflects a significant pivot towards sustainability, with conventional natural gas production projected to plummet to zero by 2050. By mid-century (specifically in the year of 2040), there is an anticipated contraction ranging from approximately 31% under National Trends+ up to ambitious decreases nearing half for scenarios DE and GA, respectively—signifying a robust commitment towards decarbonization.

In these envisioned futures, indigenous renewable methane sources such as biomethane alongside synthetic variants produced via electrolysis exhibit varied outputs in consonance with the scenarios' distinct narratives; National Trends+ anticipates a gradual augmentation of biomethane output over time. Despite its relatively modest presence, this renewable methane formulation is pivotal for offsetting conventional production declines and propelling us towards carbon neutrality by 2050—a goal shared across all scenarios with synthetic methane emerging as a critical supplementary source to meet burgeoning supply demands.

Import levels are slated for complete elimination come the mid-century mark in both DE and GA deviation pathways, underscoring an era where self-sufficiency becomes paramount within our energy matrix. Within this context, Poland's methane framework is characterized by a nuanced balance—where synthetic production slightly surpasses its counterpart scenario (Global Ambition), yet biomethane remains the predominant contributor to renewable sources in 2050 with an estimated output of around 635 TWh. By that same year, Distributed Energy is projected as a low-indigenous production model for methane alternatives—predicted at roughly 920 TWh and notable by its absence of natural gas imports come the endgame in 2050; meanwhile, Global Ambition prides itself on harmonizing high decarbonization standards with diversified global market accessibility (anticipated methane supplies reaching up to 1078 TWh), complemented by strategic energy efficiency improvements that culminate in a significant reduction of imports—to near nullity",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Grid Flows,"In our examination of methane supply dynamics within TYNDP 2024 scenarios, it is evident that a consistent reduction in indigenous natural gas production aligns with zero output by mid-century (2050). Specifically, National Trends+ anticipates a contraction to the baseline year's levels—31% less methane availability as of 2040. In contrast, scenarios DE and GA set forth more stringent targets: DE proposes an ambitious reduction by nearly half (47%) while scenario GA suggests close behind with a significant decrease to approximately four-fifths (40%).

Diverse pathways are envisaged for the augmentation of renewable methane sources, reflecting each model's narrative. The National Trends+ forecast predicts an upward trend in biomethane utilization over time and a modest expansion into synthetic gas production through electrolytic processes—collectively fulfilling the gap left by dwindling conventional natural resources.

Central to our decarbonisation strategy, biomethane emerges as an indispensable element of renewable methane supply chains in both deviation scenarios; it is projected that synthetic gas will serve a complementary role towards achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

Import reliance for these gases sees elimination across all models, with imports reaching null figures come the year of cessation (2050). The Distributed Energy scenario anticipates lower indigenous renewable methane output—about 920 TWh by mid-century —while synthetic gas production marginally surpasses counterparts in Global Ambition scenarios, at around 285 TWh. Biomethane's contribution remains vital yet understated within this framework and is expected to comprise roughly half of the renewable methane portfolio by that timeframe (635 TWh).

Conversely, in Global Ambition—a scenario designed for EU integration into a broader energy transition landscape —the projection illustrates an extensive decarbonized gas supply network amounting to 1078 TWh of renewable and synthetic sources by year-end. Noteworthy is the anticipated decline due"
4,4.5,4.5.3,Portugal,"In our examination of methane supplies within TYNDP 2024 scenarios, Figure 32 delineates a strategic decline in conventional indigenous natural gas production to reach zero by 2050 across all models evaluated. By the year 2040 relative to National Trends+ baseline of 2030 levels, there is an anticipated reduction ranging from approximately 31% under DE scenarios down to a more ambitious decrease between 47% and 40%, as per GA scenario projections.

As conventional natural gas reserves dwindle, the prominence of indigenous renewable methane sources such as biomethane and synthetic alternatives is set on an upward trajectory in these scenarios—a reflection consistent with their individual narratives. Notably, National Trends+ exhibits a gradual uptick in biomethane output over time while the scale of electrolytic-derived synthetic methane remains comparatively modest; however, collectively they are poised to bridge gaps left by conventional gas declines and facilitate overall renewable energy supply.

Biomethane emerges as a cornerstone for sustainable decarbonization of the region's natural gas inventory in both scenarios that deviate from baseline projections, effectively leading methane de-carbonisation efforts within these contextual frameworks by 2050. The synthesis and application of synthetic alternatives further underpin this strategic transition—crucial for attaining carbon neutrality objectives well into mid-century milestones.

By the year 2050, we envisage a complete cessation in methane imports across all scenarios as part of an overarching decarbonization strategy that aligns with global targets and regional sustainability goals within Portugal's energy sector framework.

The Distributed Energy scenario is characterized by relatively lower indigenous renewable and low-carbon methane production, projected at 920 TWh in the year 2050; whereas synthetic gas output slightly outpaces that of Global Ambition scenarios with an estimated total volume nearing approximately 285 TWh. Biomethane's contribution is significant yet subordinate",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Grid Flows,"In Figure 32, we observe a detailed projection of methane supplies across all three scenarios within TYNDP 2024. Each scenario anticipates an eventual cessation in conventional natural gas production by approximately 2050 due to similar declines observed thus far. By the year 2040, there is a marked reduction—31% compared with National Trends+ for DE and GA scenarios at 47% and 40%, respectively.
The distribution of indigenous renewable methane sources such as biomethane and synthetic gas reflects the strategic objectives set forth in each scenario, aligning production levels accordingly. The National Trends+ projection forecasts a steady growth trajectory for biomethane utilization over time while acknowledging that electrolytically produced synthetic methane will contribute minimally to this upward trend during the transition period leading towards 2050.
Biomethane emerges as an indispensable component in achieving a greener methane supply chain, underpinning significant strides toward decarbonization across both deviation scenarios and serving predominantly within their respective narratives of energy transformation. Synthetic gas production is projected to be the linchpin for fulfilling residual demand while facilitating ambitions towards a carbon-neutral landscape by mid-century.
By 2050, net imports are anticipated to reach zero in both scenarios—a testament to their respective commitments toward self-sufficiency and environmental stewardship within the methane sector. The Distributed Energy scenario predicts indigenous renewable sources will only account for roughly 920 TWh by this milestone, with synthetic production slightly outpacing its global counterpart at approximately 285 TWh—a figure that dwarfs biomethane's contribution of around 635 TWh. Notably absent in the Distributed Energy scenario are natural gas imports beyond a baseline established by National Trends+, culminating with zero import levels projected for year-end 2050.

A convergent trend emerges with all models projecting a cessation in conventional indigenous natural gas output by the year 2050, experiencing an approximate decline of 31% from National Trends+ baseline projections up to that point—with deviation scenarios DE and GA pursuing more aggressive reduction targets at 47% and 40%, respectively.

Diversification within renewable methane sources, specifically biomethane along with synthetic variants produced via electrolysis processes, is crucial to the narrative of each scenario's storyline. Notably, under National Trends+ projections, a discernible escalation in biomethane production emerges over time; however, contributions from synthetic methane are comparatively modest within this context. Collectively, these renewable gases serve to adequately offset the diminishing conventional natural gas reserves as part of an overall strategy towards sustainability objectives.

Biomethane stands out for its pivotal role in transforming and decarbonizing methane supplies within deviation scenarios DE and GA, signifying it as a cornerstone resource that is instrumental to achieving carbon-neutrality targets by mid-century (2050). The strategic incorporation of synthetic gases further supplements this initiative; they are envisioned not merely as an auxiliary component but rather the linchpin in realizing a fully decarbonized methane supply chain.

By 2050, import levels for conventional and renewable natural gas sources will reach nullity across all scenarios—a testament to Europe's commitment towards self-sufficiency through localised production of green alternatives within the energy matrix.

In alignment with their strategic narratives, renewable sources like biomethane are expected to rise. Synthetic methane production through electrolysis remains comparatively modest within the context of these projections but plays an indispensable role in reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 across both deviation scenarios.

By mid-century, all import levels for natural gas are slated to cease under TYNDP's vision. Specifically:
In the Distributed Energy scenario analysis, renewed and decarbonized methane production is estimated at approximately 920 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2050—with a noted emphasis on synthetic over biomethane sources; this latter accounts for about half of total output. By contrast, the Global Ambition scenario forecasts higher reliance and integration with global markets to achieve its ambitious goal: an estimated supply volume reaching upwards of 1078 TWh by year-end in a decarbonized context—down from initial imports due largely to strategic energy efficiency advancements.

Romania, as part of the EU27 cohort, is anticipated within these scenarios to contribute substantially towards achieving such methane supply ambitions through renewable and sustainably produced sources by 2050—a testament to its role in Europe's broader energy transition.

4,4.5,4.5.3,Sweden,"In accordance with Figure 32, we observe a comprehensive overview of methane provision across various scenarios within TYNDP 2024 projections for Sweden's energy landscape: conventional indigenous natural gas production is anticipated to cease by the year 2050. By this midpoint point in time (2040), there will be a notable decrease of approximately 31% from National Trends+ baseline levels, with more aggressive cuts aimed at achieving an estimated reduction between 47% and 40%, depending on the scenario—Distributed Energy (DE) or Global Ambition (GA).

In alignment with each scenario's distinct trajectory for renewable energy integration, indigenous production of biomethane is expected to rise over time. While synthetic methane via electrolysis will initially be limited in scope within the National Trends+ framework, it represents a strategic component towards achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 across both deviation pathways—DE and GA scenarios alike.

Biomethane emerges as an indispensable source of renewable methane; its critical role in decarbonizing the supply chain is underscored, serving predominantly within DE scenario projections where it accounts for roughly 635 TWh by mid-century (2050). Conversely, synthetic alternatives are recognized as pivotal to fulfilling broader methane demands and complement renewable sources in the GA model.

By establishing import levels at zero come 2050 for both scenarios reflective of Sweden's commitment toward sustainability goals; however, there is a nuanced divergence by scenario type: DE forecasts lower indigenous production volumes (920 TWh in the year 2050) with modest synthetic methane contributions at approximately 285 TWh—the lowest across all scenarios. Import reliance diminishes, absent of any natural gas requirements come mid-century within this scenario framework.

The Global Ambition (GA) model foregrounds Sweden's strategic positioning in the international energy transition narrative; it envisions a robust decarbonization agenda coupled with expansive access to global",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Grid Flows,"The methane landscape within Sweden's energy portfolio is depicted in Figure 32, which contrasts three distinct trajectories under TYNDP (Technology and Yield Development Plan) scenarios for the year 2050. Each scenario forecasts a convergence towards zero conventional indigenous natural gas production by this date—a reflection of Sweden's commitment to sustainability.

By comparing these projections with baseline figures from National Trends+ (anticipated levels in 2030), it is evident that methane output will experience a significant downturn; specifically, there are anticipated reductions by approximately 31% for the base case and even more pronounced decreases of around 47% under Distributed Energy scenarios. Concurrently, Sweden's ambition to surpass these cutbacks is manifest in its Global Ambition scenario—where a further reduction of up to 40%.

In this context, renewable methane sources such as biomethane and synthetic options gain prominence within the national energy strategy. National Trends+ predictably underscores an ascending trajectory for bio-based biomethane production coupled with a modest advancement in electrolytic synthesis of renewable methane by 2050—a pivot that ensures sufficient supply to mitigate the tapering off from traditional gas reserves.

The strategic emphasis on decarbonizing Sweden's energy mix is underscored through a pivotal reliance on biomethane, which emerges as an indispensable element in this transition phase for both deviation scenarios—underscoring its preeminence over synthetic methane. The latter contributes notably to bridging supply gaps and propelling Sweden towards the coveted milestone of carbon neutrality by 2050, with net imports falling sharply below zero as per scenario projections.

By 2050, all considered pathways predict a cessation in conventional natural gas output from indigenous sources; however, the extent and pace of decline differ significantly across these projections (Figure not included). Specifically:
- The National Trends+ scenario anticipates an overall reduction by approximately 31% compared to baseline levels achieved in 2040. In contrast, both Deviation scenarios present more aggressive targets—a drop of up to 47% and a notable decrease close to the same magnitude for Scenario GA (Global Ambition).
- The landscape concerning indigenous renewable methane sources such as biomethane will diverge according to each scenario's narrative. Notably, National Trends+ projects an uptick in biobased production over time but constrains the generation of synthetic alternatives through electrolytic processes—a strategy that aligns with a measured approach toward decarbonization (1078 TWh by 2050).
- Biomethane emerges as a pivotal renewable resource, taking on an increasing role in mitigating the carbon footprint of methane supply chains. Its contribution is especially critical across deviation scenarios and constitutes their primary decarbonization vector (920 TWh projected for Slovakia by 2050).
- While synthetic production, although limited initially under National Trends+, expands to meet the burgeoning demand—escalating around 285 TWh in Scenario GA. The interplay of biomethane and its less pronounced yet substantial presence (635 TWh by Slovakia's standards) underscores a strategic pivot toward renewable methane sources within the Distributed Energy scenario, culminating with zero natural gas imports come 2050.
- The Global Ambition framework propels an integrated EU stance in global energy transition efforts—combining high decarbonization ambitions (1078 TWh by midcentury) and leveraging diversified international markets for renewable methane procurement, while simultaneously implementing rigorous energy efficiency",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Grid Flows,"In Figure 32, we delve into methane provision projections across three distinct scenarios under TYNDP 2024 for all European Union member states, including Slovakia: National Trends+ (by 2050 a complete cessation of conventional indigenous natural gas production), Distributed Energy (emphasizing localized renewable methane sources with minimal imports by mid-century), and Global Ambition (harmonizing high decarbonization ambitions with global market access).

Analyzing these scenarios, it becomes evident that each envisages a marked decline in traditional natural gas output to reach zero by 2050. Specifically: By the year 2040, National Trends+ forecasts an approximate decrease of 31% from its baseline level recorded for 2030; Distributed Energy predicts even more significant reductions with DE and GA scenarios targeting a reduction to near-zero imports by midpoint.

In terms of renewable methane, these projections illustrate variable growth rates contingent upon scenario assumptions: National Trends+ anticipates an upward trend in biomethane production paired with modest synthetic gas output via electrolysis; Distributed Energy foresees a reliance on localized sources predominantly through bio-derived methane, while Global Ambition predicts robust expansion of both renewable and engineered (synthetic) gases to satisfy demand.

Crucially, biomethane stands out as the central player in Europe's transition towards a low carbon future across scenarios due to its significant contribution toward decarbonizing methane supply chains—a fact underscored by all three approaches aiming for zero importer levels of this gas post-2050.

Distinctive characteristics emerge within the Distributed Energy scenario, where indigenous production is forecasted to be notably lower (920 TWh) in comparison with Global Ambition's 1078 TWh by midcentury—underscoring a strategic shift towards regional self-sufficiency.

In all considered models—each reflecting divergent paths of transition within the UK's energy sector by mid-century—a consistent trend emerges. Conventional natural gas production is expected to cease entirely, reaching zero output in 2050 as outlined across multiple scenarios including National Trends+ and more aggressive deviations like DE (Deep Emission) and GA (Global Ambition).

By the year 2040, a pronounced reduction from baseline levels is anticipated. Specifically, there will be approximately a one-third decrease in traditional methane output relative to National Trends+ projections for that timeframe—31% less under DE and GA scenarios respectively. This downward trajectory underscores the UK's commitment to significantly curtailing its reliance on fossil fuels within these envisioned futures.

In parallel, a robust expansion in renewable methane sources is forecasted—comprising biomethane and synthetic variants produced via electrolytic processes. This growth aligns with each scenario's narrative trajectory: National Trends+ predicts an upsurge of bio-based gas production over time, while the DE and GA scenarios champion a higher rate of innovation leading to greater volumes by 2050—47% for DE (up from baseline) compared with only about one fifth in Natural Gas Asset Scenarios.

Biomethane emerges as an essential pillar within this renewable framework, representing the cornerstone strategy toward methane decarbonization under both deviation scenarios and serving a pivotal role throughout each projected timeline until 2050 when all imports are anticipated to be nullified.

Synthetic methods of gas production—particularly through electrolysis—while currently playing second fiddle, will likely gain prominence in the GA scenario by contributing significantly toward achieving a carbon-neutral methane supply chain and meeting net zero targets established for 2050.

",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Grid Flows,"The provided analysis of methane dynamics within various TYNDP (Technology, Policy and System Outlook) scenarios for up to 2050 reveals a unified approach toward phasing out conventional indigenous natural gas production entirely by that year. By the midpoint of this timeline in 2040, there is an anticipated decline ranging from approximately 31% under National Trends+ projections to significantly higher reductions between scenarios DE (decarbonization) and GA (Global Ambition), at rates exceeding 47% and reaching a target of near-zero imports.

Diversified production strategies for renewable methane sources, such as biomethane derived from organic waste or synthetic gas produced via electrolysis using clean energy inputs, are integral to these scenarios' narratives. The trend in the National Trends+ scenario favors a gradual augmentation of bio-based production methods alongside limited utilization of advanced technological solutions for methane generation through synthesis processes; this strategic mix is projected as sufficient for not only offsetting but exceeding conventional natural gas supply shortfalls.

Focusing on decarbonisation, biomethane emerges as a pivotal contributor to sustainable energy transitions across all scenarios by substantially mitigating greenhouse emissions and displacing fossil fuel dependency in the methane sector—a critical element of Europe's broader climate action framework. Synthetic gas production, while comparatively modest within National Trends+ due to current technological constraints or resource availability limitations, is envisioned as a cornerstone for achieving carbon neutrality targets by 2050 across more aggressive scenarios like DE and GA—where it complements biomethane production through innovative electrolysis technology.

In the Distributed Energy scenario specifically crafted to reflect Europe's decentralized energy landscape, renewable methane output is projected at 920 TWh by mid-century (2050), with a marginal increase in synthetic gas production compared to more ambitious Global Ambition projections.

- In all three key pathways—National Trends+ with a baseline scenario set at the turn of this decade, DE (Deep Decarbonization), and GA (Global Ambition)—a marked decline in conventional indigenous natural gas production is anticipated to reach nullity by 2050.
- By contrasting these scenarios with a baseline projected level for National Trends+ at the dawn of this decade, we observe notable differences: DE and GA pathways envisage more aggressive reductions in methane production—47% under Deep Decarbonization and 40% within Global Ambition.
- This shift is paralleled by a strategic increase in the deployment of indigenous renewable sources, such as biomethane (excluding imported gas) which are projected to rise significantly across all scenarios; synthetic methane through electrolysis also contributes but at varying scales.
- Biomethane emerges prominently within this context—a cornerstone for the decarbonization of our energy systems, representing a pivotal role in both DE and GA pathways while ensuring that renewable gas volumes suffice to counterbalance conventional methane's decline.
- Looking ahead into 2050 under these scenarios, synthetic production is set on the trajectory for zero imports of natural gases as part of a comprehensive decarbonization strategy—a testament to our commitment towards carbon neutrality by mid-century goals.
  
In scenario specifics:
Distributed Energy (DE) anticipates 920 TWh from indigenous renewable and biodecarbonized methane sources in the year of prediction, with a nuanced emphasis on synthetic options surpassing those under Global Ambition—at approximately 285 TWh. Biomethane's contribution stands robust at roughly 635 TWh by that same date and is notably less significant within DE when compared to the broader scope of GA, which also factors in",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Grid Flows,"The report section detailing methane production trends within various scenarios reveals a significant pivot towards sustainability by mid-century, as illustrated in Figure 32 (EU Methane Supply Projections). Underpinning this shift is the acknowledgment that conventional indigenous natural gas output will cease entirely by 2050. By contrasting with past levels observed under National Trends+ for 2030, there's a pronounced reduction of approximately 47% in DE and GA scenarios versus only about 31% in the baseline scenario—a testament to heightened ambition within these frameworks.

Central to this transformation is indigenous renewable methane production (including biomethane), which scales up commensurately with each respective narrative's trajectory, thereby mitigating declines in traditional natural gas reserves and ensuring an adequate supply of energy resources. Within the National Trends+ scenario alone, a marked progression towards greater reliance on renewable methane sources is discernible—biomethane output notably increases over time while synthetic alternatives are more conservatively leveraged due to current technological and economic constraints.

Biomethane emerges as the linchpin of decarbonization efforts, setting a precedent in both deviation scenarios for its pivotal role; however, it is supplemented by significant strides towards synthetic methane production—a strategic move to fulfill supply demands and achieve carbon neutrality objectives. By 2050, the importation of conventional gases plummets to null in both scenarios underscoring a resolute commitment toward self-sufficiency within renewable energy sources.

Furthermore, detailed examination under each scenario uncovers distinct patterns—the Distributed Energy paradigm indicates moderate levels of indigenous production for biomethane and decarbonised methane (920 TWh by 2050) with synthetic contributions also rising. Notably absent are natural gas imports in this scenario, reflecting a deliberate pivot away from traditional energy sourcing strategies towards more localized renewable alternatives that underscore the potential for distributed generation networks to meet regional demand independently of external supply chains by 205"
4,4.5,4.5.4,summary,"In this section, Figure 32 elucidates methane projections within three pivotal TYNDP (Technology and Market Development Plan) scenarios for Europe through to 2050: National Trends+, Distributed Energy, and Global Ambition. These pathways converge on the cessation of conventional indigenous gas production by mid-century. By analyzing these trajectories, we observe a substantial contraction in methane output; specifically, there is an anticipated 31% reduction from baseline National Trends+ levels come 2040—with Deforestation and Green Ambitious scenarios pushing for more stringent reductions of 47% and 40%, respectively.

The shift towards renewable methane sources, encompassing biomethane derived from organic waste as well as synthetic options created via electrolysis processes, is central to these strategies. The National Trends+ scenario predicts a gradual elevation in the production of both forms by 2050—a testament to its commitment towards sustainable energy transitions and decarbonization targets within methane supply chains.

Biomethane emerges as an indispensable element for reducing carbon emissions, dominating renewable gas contributions in both deviation scenarios that aim at zero imports by 2050—a clear indication of its pivotal role against the backdrop of a decarbonized energy landscape. Synthetic methane complements this shift and is essential to achieving net-zero emissions, aligning with ambitions for carbon neutrality in line with global standards by 2050.

In detailing country projections under these scenarios: Distributed Energy emphasizes a lower output of indigenous renewable methane (920 TWh expected) compared to the Global Ambition scenario, while maintaining robust synthetic production at approximately 285 TWh and significant biomethane contribution standing near 635 TWh by mid-century. Notably absent in this localized approach are imports of natural gas postulated for a fully decarbonised future—an ambitious yet achievable benchmark underscored throughout the report's findings.

Conversely, Global Ambition",Modelling Results,Methane ,Methane Storage,"The methane landscape within TYNDP 2024 scenarios projects a decisive shift away from conventional natural gas production, with an anticipated cessation by mid-century (2050). By this year's benchmark in the National Trends+ scenario, we observe significant reductions—31% less methane output compared to 2030 projections. However, deviating scenarios such as DE and GA pursue more aggressive targets: a reduction of upwards of half their current levels by embracing advanced renewable technologies like biomethane (47%) in the former scenario and synthetic methane via electrolysis contributing 40% to the latter.

In alignment with these ambitious scenarios, indigenous sources such as biomethane are poised for expansion—a critical element of our renewable strategy that will bolster decarbonization efforts across both deviation paths aimed at carbon neutrality by 2050. The complementary role played by synthetic methane production further solidifies the potential to satisfy burgeoning demands while maintaining zero emissions imports post-decarbonisation phase (zero import levels in TYNDP scenarios).

Focusing on national strategies, we note that within a Distributed Energy framework lies an emphasis on localized renewable and decarbonsised methane generation. The 2050 projection for this scenario stands at approximately 920 terawatt-hours (TWh), with synthetic production slightly outpacing the Global Ambition counterpart, reaching around 285 TWh—a testament to our commitment toward sustainable energy autonomy. Biomethane emerges as a significant but secondary contributor in this scenario at nearly 635 TWh by mid-century and highlights reduced import dependency (zero imports projected for the year).

On an international scale, Global Ambition represents our aspiration to synergize EU energy transitions with global markets. This strategy envisions a robust methane supply of about 1078 TWh by its midpoint in 2050 and is underpinned by aggressive decarbonization measures that will further diminish import reliance, culminating at zero natural"
